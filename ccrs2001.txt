Such deed or conveyance shall be deemed to vest in the Association the right and power to initiate all actions and procedures as the Board shall deem necessary or appropriate for the collection of such Assessments and Additional Charges and for the enforcement of the liens hereinafter provided for.
Each Assessment levied by the Association under this Article, together with all Additional Charges, shall be a separate, distinct, and personal debt and obligation of the Owner against whom it is assessed, and shall bind his or her heirs, devisees, personal representatives, successors, and assigns. Such obligation to pay Assessments and Additional Charges and the right and power of the Association to initiate all actions and procedures for collection shall run with the land, so that each successive Owner or Owners of Record of any Lot shall, in turn, become liable to pay all such Assessments and Additional Charges assessed during the time he or she is Record Owner of such Lot. After an Owner transfers of Record any Lot he or she owns, he or she shall not be liable for any Assessments levied thereafter with respect to such Lot. Such Owner shall remain personally liable, however, for all unpaid amounts due and owing at the time of transfer, together with Additional Charges accruing until time of collection. A Contract Seller of any Lot shall continue to be liable for all Assessments and Additional Charges until a conveyance by deed of such Lot is Recorded.
7.2 Creation of Lien. Each Assessment levied by the Association pursuant to this Declaration, together with all Additional Charges, shall be a charge upon the land and upon levy shall be secured by a continuing lien upon the property against which such Assessment is levied. The Association shall have a separate lien and a separate lien is hereby created upon each Lot to secure the payment of any such Assessments and Additional Charges as may be levied under this Declaration. The lien provided for herein shall continue to secure all Assessments and Additional Charges levied upon any Lot notwithstanding the transfer of Record title to such Lot, and any such transfer shall be subject to the Association's lien, provided that, prior to such transfer, a Notice of Delinquent Assessment has been Recorded as provided in this Declaration and by law.

	7.3	Purpose of Assessments. The Assessments levied by the Board shall be used exclusively
for (a) managing and operating the Development, (b) conducting the business and affairs of the Association, (c) promoting the recreation, health, safety, welfare, benefit, and interests of the Owners in relationship to the Development, (d) improving and maintaining the Common Area and, to the extent provided for in the Governing Documents or by law, the Lots situated within the Development, (e) enforcing the Governing Documents, and/or (f) otherwise benefitting the Owners.

Such estimate shall include the Club Charges and a reasonable amount allocated to contingencies and to a reserve fund for the restoration, repair, and/or replacement of those components for which the Association is responsible and which must be repaired or replaced on a periodic basis.
7.5.2 Allocation of Annual Assessment. The Board shall allocate and assess the amount of estimated required funds equally among the Lots by dividing the amount by the number of Lots. Notwithstanding the foregoing, those Residential Area Lots which receive special benefit from a Cost Center, as designated in a Notice of Annexation, shall also be subject to Cost Center assessments to reimburse the Master Association for the cost of periodic inspection, maintenance, replacement and repair, and accumulation of reserves, for the applicable Cost Center(s), in accordance with the amounts stated for such costs in the approved Cost Center Budgets for the Community. Club Charges shall be assessed in accordance with the Club Charges determined annually by the Association. The obligation to pay Club Charges with respect to all persons using facilities or receiving services of The Club based upon the membership of an Owner shall be that of such Owner.
7.5.3 Payment of Annual Assessments. Unless the Board shall designate otherwise, Annual Assessments shall be levied on an annual basis and shall be paid in twelve (12) equal monthly installments during the fiscal year, and each installment shall be due and payable on the first day of each month.

Pursuant to Civil Code Section 5600 et seq. except as otherwise provided by law, the Board shall not increase the Annual Assessment for any fiscal year above the amount of the Annual Assessment for the preceding fiscal year by more than the maximum amount permitted by law, except upon the affirmative vote or written consent of a majority of Members voting on any such increase in the Annual Assessment, provided that a quorum is established. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a quorum shall mean more than fifty percent (50%) of the Members of the Association, notwithstanding any lower quorum requirement which may be set forth in the Bylaws.

{5668.04/00423507.8}	-21-	PROPOSED /08-08-16
4676292 0258FCMP-20
deemed to be such an Enforcement Assessment), for violation of any of the provisions of the Governing Documents. Any Enforcement Assessment shall be due and payable to the Association when levied.
	7.8	Reimbursement Assessments.	The Association shall levy a Reimbursement
Assessment against any Owner and his or her Lot if a failure by such Owner, or any person or pet for whom the Owner is responsible, to comply with any provision of the Governing Documents has necessitated or resulted in an expenditure of funds by the Association to deal with such lack of compliance or to bring such Owner or his or her Lot into compliance. The Association shall also levy a Reimbursement Assessment in the event that the Association has expended funds performing emergency repairs as authorized by this Declaration or for any other reasons specifically authorized by the provisions of this Declaration. A Reimbursement Assessment shall include any costs, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the Association, including costs of collecting from an Owner any amount which the Owner is obligated to pay to the Association. A Reimbursement Assessment shall be due and payable to the Association when levied.
	7.9	Special Assessments.
7.9.1 Purpose of Special Assessments. If at any time during any fiscal year the Annual Assessment proves inadequate for any reason, including nonpayment of any Owner's share thereof or the unexpected repair, replacement, or reconstruction of Improvements located in the Development, or if funds are otherwise required for any authorized activity of the Association, the Board may levy a Special Assessment in the amount of such actual or estimated inadequacy or cost. The Board may also levy a Special Assessment for capital improvements within the Common Area. The Special Assessment power conferred hereunder is not intended to diminish the Board's obligation to plan and budget for routine maintenance, repair and replacement of Common Facilities through Annual Assessments.
7.9,2 Allocation of Special Assessments. Special Assessments shall be allocated and assessed equally among all Lots in the Development, except any Assessment against an Owner as a result of a deficiency in insurance proceeds or condemnation awards as provided in Article 7 of this Declaration.
7.9.3 Approval of Special Assessments. Except in the case of an emergency situation as defined in Civil Code Section 5600 et seq. in any fiscal year the Board may not levy Special Assessments which, in the aggregate, exceed five percent (5%) of the budgeted gross expenses of the Association for that fiscal year, except upon the affirmative vote or written consent of a majority of the Members voting on any such Special Assessment, provided that a quorum is established. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a quorum shall mean more than fifty percent (50%) of the Members of the Association, notwithstanding any lower quorum requirement which may be set forth in the Bylaws.
7.10 Non-Member Area Payments.
7.10.1 Establishment of Non-Member Area Payments. At least thirty (30) days prior to the start of each Fiscal Year, or the start of any partial fiscal year, the Master Association shall estimate and establish the costs and expense for the maintenance of the water quantity and quality of the Lake, including, but not limited to: (a) costs for the supply of water to and from the Lake including pumping equipment, pipes, gates and valves; and (b) maintenance of the Lake water
{5668.04/00423507.8}	-22-	PROPOSED / 08-08-16
4676292-180-22-49
4676292 0258FC MP-21
quality, including application of chemicals, use of any other water quality control system, and the costs of any fountains in the Lake maintained by the Master Association.
The appropriate portion of the amounts so established shall be assessed as a "Non-Member Area Assessment" against the Lots within the Non-Member Areas based upon the ratio that the aggregate number of acres in the Non-Member Areas, calculated to the tenth of an acre, bears to 331.2 acres minus the acreage occupied by the Lake, the Recreational Facility, and any public park, public school site, or other publicly owned real property, located within such area.
331.2 acres is the entire area using the Lake for storm water drainage. This area is identical to the area that is originally subject to this Declaration plus the Lake and the area that is subject to Annexation by the Declarant. The assessment shall be payable at such time and in such installments as the Board may designate. The aggregate Non-Member Area Assessment shall be allocated to and levied against the Lots within the respective portions of the Non-Member Areas as follows, subject to the power and authority of the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, to reallocate and reapportion such amounts from time to time among the respective Lots, based upon changes in use, or otherwise, in order to maintain fairness in such allocations:

The Master Association may also levy a special assessment against any Owner of a Non-Member Area Lot to reimburse the Master Association for costs incurred in bringing the Owner and his or her Lot into compliance with the provisions of the Master Declaration, any amendments thereto, the Articles, the Bylaws, and the Rules and Regulations, which special assessment may be levied upon the vote of the Board after notice and an opportunity for a hearing which satisfy the requirements of Section 7341 of the California Corporations Code, as set forth in the Bylaws.

7.15 Offsets.

7.16 Payment Under Protest. If a dispute exists between the Owner of a Lot and the
association regarding any disputed charge or sum levied by the Association, including, but not limited to n Assessment, fine, penalty, late fee, collection cost, or monetary penalty imposed as a disciplinary measure, and the amount in dispute does not exceed the jurisdictional limits set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure Sections 116.220 and 116.221, or comparable successor statute, the Owner may, in addition to pursing dispute resolution, pay under protest the disputed amount and all other amounts levied, including any fees and reasonable costs of collection, reasonable attorney's fees, late charges, and interest, if any, pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 5658, and commence an action in small claims court.

Except as prohibited by law, upon any delinquency in payment, the Association may, at its option, declare the entire balance of all sums then due or to become due from the Owner, immediately due and payable, which total sum may then be included in any suit, action, or other procedure initiated to collect such sums, including all Additional Charges. The Board may commence any procedure for the collection of delinquent Assessments upon its own decision. The remedies provided in this Declaration for collection of delinquent Assessments shall be cumulative and not exclusive.
7.18 Power of Sale. Each Owner does hereby appoint the Association as trustee to enforce and to foreclose any lien which is established pursuant to the terms of this Declaration, by private power of sale, as provided in Division III, Part 4, Title 14, Chapter 2, Article 1, of the California Civil Code, and does further grant to the Board, on behalf of the Association, the authority and power to sell the Lot of such Owner in the event of any default in payment of any Assessments or Additional Charges levied against such Lot, for lawful money of the United States, to the highest bidder, to satisfy such lien, except as prohibited by law.

Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the lien securing each of the Assessments provided for under this Article shall have priority as of the date of Recording of the original declaration applicable to the Development over all other liens and encumbrances applicable to the Lots. Notwithstanding the preceding, a lien for Assessments which have become due and payable prior to the sale of a Lot pursuant to a decree of foreclosure of a First Mortgage, or pursuant to a power of sale contained in any such First Mortgage, shall be subordinate to the lien of any First Mortgage Recorded against the Lot. Such foreclosure sale shall not relieve the Lot from liability for any Assessments and Additional Charges thereafter becoming due, nor from the lien of any subsequent Assessment.

The Association hereby confers on each Owner the authority to collect and retain the rents and other monies derived from any such lease or agreement as they become due and payable, provided that the Association at its sole discretion, may revoke such authority at any time, upon written notice to the Owner of a default in the payment of any Assessment due hereunder.

The Architectural Control Committee's (or subcommittee's) approval or disapproval of a submission shall be based solely on the consideration set forth in this Article, and in such rules and regulations as may be promulgated by the Association, and the Architectural Control Committee shall not be responsible for reviewing, nor shall its approval of any plan or design be deemed approval of, any plans or design from the standpoint of structural safety and conformance with building or other codes.
10.22 Compliance with Governmental Requirements. The application to the Association, and the review and approval of any proposals, plans, or other submittals, shall in no way be deemed to be satisfaction of or compliance with any building permit process or any other governmental requirements, the responsibility for which lies solely with the respective Owner, nor shall it constitute the assumption of any responsibility by or impose any liability on the Board, the Architectural Committee, or their members as to the accuracy, efficacy, or sufficiency of such proposals, plans or other submittals.

10.23 Variances. The Architectural Control Committee may, with approval of the Board, grant reasonable variances in any procedures specified in this Article 9 in order to overcome practical difficulties, avoid unnecessary expense or prevent unnecessary hardship, provided the following conditions are met:
10.23.1 The Architectural Control Committee must make a good faith written determination that: (a) the requested variance does not constitute a material deviation from the overall plan and scheme of the Development or from any restriction contained in the Declaration or that the proposal allows the objectives of the violated restriction(s) to be substantially achieved despite noncompliance; or (b) that the variance relates to a restriction or requirement that is unnecessary or burdensome under the circumstances; or (c) that the variance, if granted, will not result in a material detriment, or create an unreasonable nuisance, with respect to any other Lot, Common Area or Owner in the Development.
10.23.2 After the conclusion of the hearing, the Architectural Control Committee shall consult with the Board render a determination to either grant or deny the request for variance in accordance with the standards set forth in this section.
ARTICLE 11 ENFORCEMENT
11.1	Violations as Nuisance. Every act or omission constituting or resulting in a violation of
any of the provisions of the Governing Documents shall be deemed to constitute a nuisance. In addition to any other remedies which may be available, such nuisance may be abated or enjoined by the Association, its officers, the Board or by any Owner. The Board shall not be obligated to take action to abate or enjoin a particular violation if, in the exercise of its discretion, the Board determines that acting to abate or enjoin such violation is not likely to foster or protect the interests of the Association and its Members as a whole.
11.2 Violation of Law. Any violation of a state, municipal or local law, ordinance or regulation pertaining to the ownership, occupancy, or use of any property within the Development is hereby declared to be a violation of this Declaration and subject to any and all of the enforcement procedures set forth herein.
11.3 Owners' Responsibility for Conduct and Damages. Each Owner shall be fully responsible for informing the members of his or her household and his or her tenants, Contract Purchasers, contractors and guests of the provisions of the Governing Documents, and shall be fully responsible for the conduct, activities, any Governing Document violation of any of them, and for any damage to the Development or the Association resulting from the negligent or intentional conduct of any of them or any household pets. If a Lot is owned jointly by two (2) or more persons, the liability of each Owner in connection with the obligations imposed by the Governing Documents shall be joint and several.
11.4 No Avoidance. No Owner may avoid the burdens or obligations imposed by the Governing Documents through non-use of any Common Area facilities, if any, or by abandonment of his or her Lot.

{5668.04100423507.8}	-37-	PROPOSED / 08-08-16
4676292 0258FCMP-28
11.5.1 Enforcement Rights. The Association, its Directors, officers, or agents, and any Owner shall have the right to enforce any and all provisions of the Governing Documents by any proceeding at law or in equity, or through the use of such other remedies as are available and deemed appropriate by the Board. Each remedy provided is cumulative and not exclusive. The Board shall not be obligated to take action to enforce a provision of the Governing Documents if, in the exercise of its discretion, the Board determines that acting to enforce the provision is not likely to foster or protect the interests of the Association and its Members as a whole.
11.5.2 Member Not In Good Standing. Upon a determination by the Board of Directors, after prior notice to the affected Member and an opportunity for a hearing, that such Member has violated any provision of the Governing Documents including a failure to pay any Assessment when due, the Board shall give notice in writing to such Member that he or she is deemed not to be a Member in Good Standing. Such Member shall be deemed to remain in that status until such time as the Board shall determine in writing that the violation which resulted in the Board's determination has been cured or remedied or, on some other basis as in the judgment of the Board is just and proper, that such Member shall again be deemed to be a Member in Good Standing of the Association. Such Member shall be so notified in writing with a copy given to the Secretary.
11.5.3 Imposition of Sanctions. In the event of a breach or infraction of any provision of the Governing Documents by an Owner, members of an Owner's household, or his or her tenants, Contract Purchasers, contractors, guests or invitees, the Board shall have the power to impose sanctions against the Owner. Such sanctions may include, without limitation, the imposition of fines and/or the suspension of an Owner's rights as a Member, including an Owner's voting rights or an Owner's right to use the recreational or community facilities, if any, on the Common Area. Except as provided in Section 11.7 below, imposition of sanctions shall be effective only after notice and an opportunity for hearing as provided in Section 8.1.4 of the Bylaws. The payment of any such fine may be enforced as an Enforcement Assessment as provided in Section 6.8 of this Declaration as well as in any manner permitted by law. Further, each Owner shall be obligated to pay Reimbursement Assessments levied by the Board for reimbursement of any costs incurred by the Association relating to violation of any provisions of the Governing Documents by the members of such Owner's household and such Owner's tenants, Contract Purchasers, guests, pets, or other invitees.
11.5.4 Inadequacy of Legal Remedy. Except for the non-payment of any Assessment levied pursuant to the provisions of Article 7 of this Declaration, it is hereby declared that a remedy at law to recover damages for a default in the performance of any of the terms and provisions of any of the Governing Documents or for the breach or violation of any such provisions is inadequate and that the failure of any Owner or a member of the household of any Owner or an Owner's tenants, guests, or household pets or any other occupant or user of any of the property within the Development to comply with any provision of the Governing Documents may be enjoined in any judicial proceedings initiated by the Association, its Officers or Board of Directors, or by any Owner or by their respective successors in interest.
11.5.5 Limitation on Disciplinary Rights. The Association shall not have the power and authority to cause a forfeiture or abridgment of a Member's right to the full use and occupancy of his or her Lot as the result of the failure by such Owner, members of such

4676292 0258FCMP-29
Owner's household, or his or her tenants, guests, invitees or household pets to comply with any provision of the Governing Documents, except where such forfeiture or abridgement is the result of the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, a decision arising out of an arbitration proceeding, or a foreclosure or sale under private power of sale for failure of such Owner to pay Assessments levied by the Association pursuant to Article 6 of this Declaration. The provisions of this subsection shall not affect the Association's right to impose fines or monetary penalties or to suspend an Owner's membership rights, as provided in the Governing Documents.
11.6 Disciplinary Rules. The Board may adopt rules and regulations that further elaborate upon and refine procedures for conducting disciplinary proceedings and otherwise imposing sanctions upon Members of the Association for violation of provisions of the Governing Documents. Such rules, when approved and adopted by the Board, shall be deemed to be a part of the Association Rules provided for in, and constituting a part of, the Governing Documents.
11.7 Emergency Situations. The following shall constitute emergency situations: (a) an immediate and unreasonable threat to the safety of Residents of the Development, (b) a traffic or fire hazard, or (c) a threat of material damage to or destruction of the Development or any portion thereof. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Governing Documents, under circumstances involving conduct that constitutes an emergency situation, the Association may undertake immediate corrective or disciplinary action. Hearings with respect to such corrective or disciplinary action shall be in accordance with Section 8.1.4(c) of the Bylaws.
11.8 Alternative Dispute Resolution. Compliance with Civil Code Sections 5900 et seq. and Civil Code Sections 5925 et seq. shall be required with respect to any dispute subject to such sections.
11.9 Non-Waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of the Governing Documents at any time shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to do so thereafter with respect to the same or any other violation of any provision of the Governing Documents.
11.10 Notices. Any notices required or given under this Article shall conform to Section 8.1.4 of the Bylaws.
11.11 Costs and Attorneys' Fees. In the event the Association shall take any action to enforce any of the provisions of the Governing Documents or shall determine that any Member or members of his or her household or his or her tenants, Contract Purchasers, guests, invitees or household pets have violated any provision of the Governing Documents, and whether or not legal or judicial proceedings are initiated, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover the full amount of all costs incurred, including attorneys' fees, in responding to such a violation and/or in enforcing any Governing Document provision. The remedies of the Association to recover the amount of such costs and attorneys' fees shall include, without limitation, the imposition of a Reimbursement Assessment as provided in Section 6.7 of this Declaration.
11.12 Indemnification. Each Owner, by acceptance of his or her deed, agrees for himself or herself and for the members of his or her household, his or her Contract Purchasers, tenants, guests or invitees, to (a) indemnify each and every other Owner for, (b) to hold each and every other Owner harmless from, and (c) to defend each and every other Owner against, any claim of any person for personal injury or property damage occurring within the Lot of such Owner, except that such Owner's liability may be diminished to the extent that the injury or damage occurred by reason of the negligence of any other Owner or person temporarily visiting in such Lot or is fully covered by insurance.
