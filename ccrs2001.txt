4.3.3 Voting by Delegates. Each Delegate District shall elect one Delegate and one alternate Delegate to the Master Association to exercise the voting power of all of the Class A and Class B Members in such Delegate District. If Declarant furnishes voting instructions to a Delegate in connection with Class A or Class B votes attributable to Lots or Condominiums owned by Declarant or a Merchant Builder or subject to a proxy in favor of Declarant, the Delegate shall cast such votes in the manner specified by such voting instructions. Any Class C vote shall be cast by Declarant through its authorized representative. The chairperson of any meeting at which a Delegate or alternate Delegate is elected shall certify in writing to the Board the name and address of the Delegate and alternate elected, the time and place of the meeting at which the election occurred and the Delegate District which the Delegates represent. Each Delegate shall be entitled to cast the Class A and Class B votes representing Lots or Condominiums in his Delegate District with respect to each such Lot or Condominium only during such periods as the Owner of such Lot or Condominium is entitled to cast votes for the election of a Delegate as provided herein. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.3.4 below (matters requiring the vote of only a majority of a quorum of Members), Delegates shall cast the votes "for" and "against" any matter voted upon by the Members they represent in the same manner and proportion as such votes were cast by such Members, but shall be free to exercise their independent discretion as to how to vote any Absentee Votes (defined below). In order that the business of the Master Association not be hindered by lack of a quorum, the Delegates shall in all cases cast all the votes to which the Members they represent are entitled, regardless of whether such votes were actually cast by such Members or are Absentee Votes. Delegates may only act personally at a meeting of the Delegates of the Master Association or by written ballot, and may not act by proxy. If a Delegate ("Absent Delegate") is not present at a duly called meeting of the Delegates, then the alternate for such Absent Delegate may attend the meeting and exercise all rights, powers and votes to which the Absent Delegate would be entitled. If the Absent Delegate should arrive prior to the adjournment of any such meeting, the alternate shall no longer be entitled to act in the place of the Absent Delegate; provided that such relinquishment of authority by the alternate shall not invalidate any matter previously voted or acted upon by the alternate in his temporary capacity as Delegate.
4.3.3.1 Special Groups. Where the votes of a special group of Members are required, such as Lake Lot Owners or Members other than Declarant, each Delegate shall segregate the votes of the members of such special group separately from other Members, and cast the votes of such group separately as though such votes were cast in a separate election at which only such group was voting. If a Delegate is casting votes for more than one (1) of such groups, the Delegate shall segregate the votes cast for each such group.
4.3.3.2 Delegate Qualifications. Delegates must be (a) an authorized agent or employee of Declarant, or (b) a Member of the Master Association in good standing. If the Member is a corporation, partnership, or other such entity, the authorized agent of such corporation, partnership or other entity shall be eligible for election as a Delegate, but may serve in such capacity only until such authorized agency is terminated. With the exception of Delegates who are agents or employees of Declarant, upon termination of any Delegate's membership in the Master Association, such Delegate shall be disqualified from serving the

4.3.3.3 Delegate Terms. Each Delegate shall serve a term of one (1) year (except that Delegates who hold such position by being officers of a Sub-Association serve for a period equal to the term of such office). The office of a Delegate shall be deemed vacant upon the death, resignation, removal or judicial adjudication of mental incompetence of the Delegate, or upon the Delegate's failure to satisfy all of the qualifications of Delegates as specified in the foregoing Section, or in case the Members in any Delegate District fail to elect a Delegate. Delegate vacancies caused by any reason other than the removal of a Delegate shall first be filled by the alternate Delegate, and if there is no alternate Delegate, by a special election within the Delegate District which shall be called and conducted by the Board either upon its own motion or upon receipt of a petition for such election signed by at least five percent (5%) of the Members within such Delegate District. Subject to the eligibility and vacancy provisions herein, each such person shall serve the remainder of the unexpired term of office of the predecessor Delegate, or until a successor is elected at a meeting of the Members in such Delegate District.
4.3.3.4 Removal of Delegates. A Delegate may be removed without cause by the vote in person or by proxy of a majority of a quorum of Members in a Delegate District, cast at any duly held meeting; provided, that in no event shall a Delegate be removed unless that votes cast in favor of such removal equal at least the lesser of: (a) the number of votes which elected such Delegate to his current term, or (b) a majority of the total voting power of the Members in such Delegate District.
4.3.4 Allocation of Delegate Votes. Whenever a matter which this Master Declaration requires to be approved by the vote of Delegates representing a majority or other specified percentage of the total voting power of the Master Association (i.e., excluding matters requiring a mere majority of a quorum of Delegates as delmed in the Bylaws, and excluding the election of Directors by the Class C Members) is presented to the Delegates for approval, written notice of the substance of such matter shall be given to the Delegates at least sixty (60) days prior to the date on which such matter is scheduled to be discussed at a meeting of the Delegates. During such sixty (60) day period, the Delegates shall submit such matter to a vote of the Members within their respective Delegate Districts. When voting on any such specified matter, each Delegate shall cast all of the votes which he represents as follows:
4.3.4.1 The Delegate shall cast votes attributable to Owners actually voting (whether in person, by proxy or written ballot) in such Delegate District "for" or "against" such specified matter in the same manner and proportion as such votes were cast by the voting Owners;

(a) If fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the votes in the Delegate District attributable to Owners other than Declarant have been cast pursuant to paragraph 4.3.4.1 above, then any Absentee Votes attributable to Owners other than Declarant shall be cast "for" or "against" the specified matter in the same proportion as the votes actually cast by the Owners other than Declarant pursuant to paragraph 4.3.4.1 above.
(b) If less than fifty-one percent (51%) of the votes in the Delegate District attributable to Owners other than Declarant have been cast pursuant to paragraph 4.3.4.1 above, then the Absentee Votes attributable to Owners other than Declarant shall be voted "for" or "against" the specified matter in such proportions as the Delegate shall, in his or her sole discretion, determine to be appropriate.
(c) Absentee Votes cast on behalf of Declarant shall be cast in the same proportion as the votes actually cast by Declarant.
4.3.5 Voting Reports. In order to verify compliance with the foregoing voting requirements, each ballot cast by a Delegate shall contain such Delegate's certification of the following information: (a) the total number and classification of votes in the Delegate District; (b) the total number and classification of votes cast "for" and "against" the specified matter on behalf of Declarant in response to instructions given pursuant to paragraph 4.3.4.1; (c) the total number of votes cast "for" and "against" the specified matter on behalf of Members other than Declarant in response to instructions given pursuant to Section 4.3.4.1; (d) the total number and classification of Absentee Votes in such Delegate District attributable to Declarant and the total number of Absentee Votes attributable to Members other than Declarant; and (e) the total number and classification of votes cast by such Delegate "for" and "against" the specified matter. The inspector of election shall tabulate the total number and classification of votes cast by all Delegates in each of the foregoing categories in order to determine whether the necessary approvals have been obtained. It will be conclusively presumed for all purposes of Master Association business that each Delegate casting votes on behalf of the Owners of Lots or Condominiums in his Delegate District will have acted with the authority and consent of all such Owners. All agreements and determinations lawfully made by the Master Association in accordance with the voting procedures established herein, and in the Bylaws, shall be deemed to be binding upon all Members, Owners and their respective successors and assigns.
4.3.6 Meetings of the membership of the Master Association shall be conducted in accordance with a recognized system of parliamentary procedure or such parliamentary procedures as the Master Association may adopt. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, notice of meetings of the Delegates shall specify those matters the Board intends to present for action by the Members but, except as otherwise provided by Law, any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for action.

5.3.3 From and after the first day of the fiscal year immediately following the conveyance of the first Residential Area Lot or Condominium in a Phase to an Owner, the maximum annual assessment may be increased by the Board in an amount above the amount provided in subparagraph 5.3.1 by the vote or written assent of Delegates representing at least a majority of Owners in the Master Association constituting a quorum (as defined below), provided that the Board of Directors has prepared and distributed a pro forma operating budget to all members of the Master Association as provided in Section 6.2 below. For purposes of this Article 5, "quorum" means more than fifty percent (50%) of the Owners of the Master Association applied separately with respect to each Delegate District whose votes are represented. The Master Association shall provide notice by first-class mail to each Owner of any increase in the regular assessments of the Master Association, not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the increased assessment becoming due. Increases resulting from annexation of an additional Phase, the approved budget for which contains a higher maximum annual assessment amount than that in effect prior to such annexation, are not subject to this limitation.
5.3.4 Said maximum assessment may be reduced by maintenance or subsidy agreements approved by the California Department of Real Estate and reflected in a Final Subdivision Public Report.
5.3.5 The Board of Directors may fix the annual assessment at an amount not in excess of the maximum.
5.3.6 The restrictions on increases in assessments contained in this Section 5.3 shall be applied separately to the annual assessments applicable to all Lots and Condominiums, and to each of the separate Cost Centers applicable only to a particular group of Lots or Condominiums subject to Cost Center assessments. Increases in the Cost Center assessments, for each separate Cost Center, above the stated limits shall require the approving vote or written consent of a majority of a quorum of the Members subject to Cost Center assessments for the particular Cost Center for which an increase is proposed, in accordance with the procedures of this Article as applied to such Members.
5.3.7 With specific reference to the Club Charge, the initial Club Operating Budget (which shall consist of a separate budget for The Club, or those items of cost designated as costs of The Club in the Budget approved by the California Department of Real Estate for Phase 1 of the Community) shall become effective and operative on the later of (a) date of filing of a Notice of Completion for The Club At Westlake, and (b) the close of escrow for the sale of the first Residential Area Lot to an Owner, and the assessment of Club Charges shall also commence as of such date. Thereafter, the monthly Club Charge assessed per Residential Area Lot or per Condominium shall be as established by the Operator in accordance with the Operator Agreement and disclosed in the Final Subdivision Public Report, for the particular Phase of the Community, and any amendments thereto, and in accordance with the Club Operating Budgets in effect from time to time.

After commencement of assessments under said initial budget, the cost of cable TV services will be collected by the Master Association.
Section 5.4 Special Assessments. In addition to the annual assessments authorized above, the Master Association may levy, in any assessment year, a special assessment applicable to that year only for the purpose of defraying, in whole or in part, the cost of any construction, reconstruction, repair or replacement of a capital improvement upon the Master Common Area, including fixtures and personal property related thereto, or otherwise, provided that any such assessment for capital improvements to the Master Common Area which total more than five percent (5%) of the budgeted gross expenses of the Master Association for that fiscal year shall have the vote or written assent of Delegates representing a majority of the Owners constituting a quorum; and, further provided, that any such assessment for capital improvements to the Cost Center within any Delegate District, which total more than five percent (5%) of the budgeted gross expenses of the Master Association with respect to such Cost Center for that fiscal year, shall have the vote or written assent of a majority of the Owners within the affected Delegate District constituting a quorum. The Master Association may also levy a special assessment against any Member to reimburse the Master Association for costs incurred in bringing the Member and his Residential Area Lot or Condominium into compliance with the provisions of the Master Declaration, any amendments thereto, the Articles, the Bylaws, and the Rules and Regulations, which special assessment may be levied upon the vote of the Board after notice and an opportunity for a hearing which satisfy the requirements of Section 7341 of the California Corporations Code, as set forth in the Bylaws.

Club Charges shall be assessed in accordance with the Club Charges determined annually by the Operator of The Club. The obligation to pay Club Charges with respect to all persons using facilities or receiving services of The Club based upon the membership of an Owner shall be that of such Owner.
Section 5.7 Date of Commencement of Annual Assessments; Due Dates. The annual assessments provided for herein shall commence as to all Residential Area Lots or Condominiums in the first Phase of the Community on the date of close of escrow for the sale of the first Residential Area Lot or Condominium to an Owner.

sale of the first Residential Area Lot or Condominium in such Phase to an Owner. The due dates for assessments shall be established by the Board of Directors. If any payment of an assessment installment is less than the amount assessed and the payment does not specify the assessment fund or account into which it is to be deposited, it shall first be applied to pay general annual assessments for operating costs until the amount due therefor is satisfied, then to pay the Cost Center operating cost assessment (if any) due from such Owner until the amount due therefor is satisfied, then to pay the general reserve fund until the amount due therefor is satisfied, and, any remaining amount shall be applied to pay the reserve fund for the Cost Center for which such Owner is responsible.

Monthly Club Charge assessments shall commence as to any Lot or Condominium owned by a Merchant Builder, Declarant or any other Owner, on the date on which such Lot or Condominium is annexed to the Master Association; provided, however, that Club Charge assessments shall not commence as to any Lot or Condominium until the date on which a Notice of Completion is filed for The Club. Club Charge assessments are due and payable in the same manner and at the same times as monthly installments of annual assessments, and the same collection and enforcement procedures apply. Amounts received on account of Club Charge Assessments shall be applied in the following order of priority: (1) to payment of interest due under the Lease-Purchase Agreement; (2) payment of Club Operating Costs; (3) to accumulation of required reserves; (4) payment of the Club Operator's Management Fee; and (5) payment of principal due under the Lease-Purchase Agreement.
Section 5.9 Non-Member Area Payments.
5.9.1 Establishment of Non-Member Area Payments. At least thirty (30) days prior to the start of each Fiscal Year, or the start of any partial fiscal year, the Master Association shall estimate and establish the costs and expense for the maintenance of the water quantity and quality of the Lake, including, but not limited to: (i) costs for the supply of water to and from the Lake induding pumping equipment, pipes, gates and valves; and (ii) maintenance of the Lake water quality, including application of chemicals, use of any other water quality control system, and the costs of any fountains in the Lake maintained by the Master Association. The appropriate portion of the amounts so established shall be assessed as a "Non-Member Area Assessment" against the Lots within the Non-Member Areas based upon the ratio that the aggregate number of acres in the Non-Member Areas, calculated to the tenth of an acre, bears to 331.2 acres minus the acreage occupied by the Lake, the Recreational Facility, and any public park, public school site, or other publicly owned real property, located within such area. 331.2 acres is the entire area using the Lake for storm water drainage. This area is identical to the area that is originally subject to this Declaration plus the Lane and the area that is subject to Annexation by the Declarant. The assessment shall be payable at such time and in such installments as the Board may designate. The aggregate Non-Member Area Assessment shall be allocated to and levied against the Lots within the respective portions of the Non-Member Areas as follows, subject to the power and authority of the Board, in its sole and absolute

The Master Association shall provide notice by first-class mail to each Owner of a Non-Member Area Lot of any increase in the special assessments or Non-Member Area Assessments levied against Non-Member Area Lots, not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the increased assessment becoming due.

assessment is not paid within thirty (30) days after the date said assessment is due, the assessment shall bear interest from the due date at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum. The Master Association may bring an action at law against the Owner personally obligated to pay same, and in addition thereto, or in lieu thereof, after the expiration of thirty (30) days following recordation thereof, may foredose the lien provided herein below against the Lot or Condominium.
5.10.1 Any assessment not received by the Master Association within fifteen (15) days after the due date shall be delinquent. Before the Master Association may place a lien upon the Lot or Condominium of an Owner as provided herein, the Master Association shall notify such Owner in writing by certified mail of the fee and penalty procedures of the Master Association, provide an itemized statement which indicates the principal amount owed, any late charges and the method of calculation, any attorney's fees, and the collection practices used by the Master Association, including the right of the Master Association to the reasonable costs of collection. The amount of any such delinquent assessment or installment, together with any accompanying late charges, interest, costs (induding reasonable attorneys' fees), and penalties, as provided for in this Master Declaration, shall be and become a lien on the Lot or Condominium against which the assessment is levied when the Master Association causes to be recorded a Notice of Delinquent Assessment (herein the "Notice") in the office of the County Recorder of the County in which the Lot or Condominium is located. The Notice shall describe the amount of such delinquent assessment or installment and such other charges thereon as may be authorized by this Master Declaration, a legal description of the Lot or Condominium against which the same has been assessed, the name of the Owner, and, if the lien is to be enforced by the power of sale under nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings, the name and address of the trustee authorized by the Master Association to enforce the lien by sale. Such Notice shall be signed by the president or vice-president, and the secretary or assistant secretary of the Master Association or any employee or agent of the Master Association authorized to do so by the Board and shall be mailed in the manner set forth in Civil Code Section 2924b to all record owners of the Owner's interest in the Lot or Condominium no later than ten (10) calendar days after recordation. Unless the Board considers the immediate recording of the Notice to be in the best interests of the Master Association, the Notice shall not be recorded until fifteen (15) calendar days after the Master Association has delivered the above-described required written notice of default. Any payments received by the Master Association on account of such a debt shall first be applied to the principal amount owed, and only after the principal amount owed is paid in full shall such payments be applied to interest or collection expenses If the delinquent assessment or installment and related charges are paid or otherwise satisfied, the Master Association shall record a notice of satisfaction and release of lien.
5.10.2 The Board may, after the expiration of thirty (30) days following recordation thereof, enforce any assessment lien provided for in Section 5.9 hereinabove, by filing an action for judicial foreclosure or, if the Notice contained the name and address of the trustee authorized by the Master Association to enforce the lien by nonjudicial foreclosure, by recording a notice of default in the form described in Civil Code Section 2924c(b)(1) to commence a nonjudicial foreclosure. Any nonjudicial foreclosure shall be conducted in accordance with the

requirements of Civil Code Sections 2924, 2924b, 2924c, 2924f, 2924g, and 2924h that apply to nonjudicial foreclosures of Mortgages or deeds of trust. The sale shall be conducted by the trustee named in the Notice of Delinquent Assessment or by a trustee substituted in accordance with the provisions of the California Civil Code. The Master Association may bid on the Lot or Condominium at the sale, and may hold, lease, mortgage, and convey the acquired Lot or Condominium. If the default is cured before the sale, or before completing a judicial foreclosure, induding payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Master Association, the Master Association shall record a Notice of Satisfaction and Release of Lien, and on receipt of a written request by the Owner, a Notice of Rescission of the Master Declaration of Default and Demand for Sale. Suit to recover a money judgment for unpaid assessments, rent and attorneys' fees shall be maintainable without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing the same.
5.10.3 A monetary penalty imposed by the Association as a disciplinary measure for (a) failure of an Owner to comply with this Declaration, and the Articles, Bylaws or Rules and Regulations of the Association, or (b) as a means of reimbursing the Association for costs incurred by the Association in the repair of damages to the Common Area and facilities for which the Owner or the Owner's guests or tenants is allegedly responsible, or (c) to bring an Owner or its Lot into compliance with this Declaration, and the Articles, Bylaws or Rules and Regulations of the Association shall not be treated as an assessment which may become a lien against the Owner's Lot enforceable by a sale of the Lot in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2924, 2924b and 2924c of the California Civil Code. This Section shall not apply to charges imposed against an Owner which are reasonable late payment penalties for delinquent assessments nor charges to reimburse the Master Association for the loss of interest and for costs reasonably incurred (including attorneys' fees) in its efforts to collect delinquent assessments.
5.10.4 In addition to the lien power described hereinabove, each Owner vests in the Master Association or its assigns, the right and power to bring all actions at law against such Owner or other Owners for the collection of delinquent assessments. In lieu of bringing an action at law to collect delinquent assessments, the Master Association may submit the matter to arbitration pursuant to the Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The decision of the arbitrator on such delinquent assessment shall be binding on both the Master Association and the delinquent Owner and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The fee to initiate such arbitration shall be paid by the Master Association and shall be recoverable as part of the arbitration award, in addition to the late charges and interest on the delinquent assessment as provided above.
Section 5.11 Policies for Assessment Collection. The Board of Directors shall annually distribute within sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of the fiscal year a statement of the Master Association's policies and practices for enforcing its remedies against Members for defaults in the payment of annual and special assessments, including the recording and foreclosing of liens against Members' Lots and Condominiums.

Section 5.12 Subordination of the Lien to First Deeds of Trust and First Mortgages. The lien for the assessments provided for herein shall be subordinate to the lien of any first Mortgage upon any Lot or Condominium. Sale or transfer of any Lot or Condominium shall not affect the assessment lien. However, the sale or transfer of any Lot or Condominium pursuant to judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure of a first Mortgage or any conveyance in lieu thereof shall extinguish the lien of such assessments as to payments which became due prior to such sale or transfer. No sale or transfer shall relieve such Lot or Condominium from lien rights for any assessments thereafter becoming due. Where the Mortgagee of a first Mortgage of Record or other purchaser of a Lot or Condominium obtains title to the same as a result of foreclosure or conveyance in lieu thereof, such acquirer of title, his successors and assigns, shall not be liable for the share of the common expenses or assessments by the Master Association chargeable to such Lot or Condominium which became due prior to the acquisition of title to such Lot or Condominium by such acquirer. Such unpaid share of common expenses or assessments shall be deemed to be common expenses collectible from all of the Lots and Condominiums including such acquirer, his successors and assigns.
Section 5.13 Estoppel Certificate. The A/aster Association shall furnish or cause an appropriate officer to furnish, upon demand by any person, a certificate signed by an officer of the Master Association setting forth whether the assessments on a specified Lot or Condominium have been paid. A properly executed certificate of the Master Association as to the status of assessments on a Lot or Condominium is binding upon the Master Association as of the date of its issuance.
Section 5.14 Personal Liability of Owner. No Owner may exempt himself from personal liability for assessments, nor any part thereof (including the charges for cable television service), levied by the Master Association, nor release the Lot or Condominium owned by him from the liens and charges hereof by waiver of the use and enjoyment of the Master Common Area and facilities thereon, or by abandonment of his Lot or Condominium. Similarly, no Member may exempt himself from personal liability for payment of Club Charge assessments levied by the Master Association, nor release the Lot or Condominium owned by him from the liens and charges thereof by waiver of the use and enjoyment of facilities and services of The Club, or because of non-use or abandonment of such Member's Lot or Condominium.
Section 5.15 Exempt Property. All Properties dedicated to and accepted by a local public authority, and all Properties owned by a charitable nonprofit organization exempt from taxation by the laws of the State of California, shall be exempt from the assessments created herein. However, no real property or improvements devoted to dwelling use shall be exempt from said assessments.

However, prior to the imposition or collection of an assessment under this subparagraph (c), the Board shall pass a resolution containing written findings as to the necessity of the extraordinary expense involved and why the expense was not or could not have been reasonably foreseen in the budgeting process, and the resolutions shall be distributed to the members with the notice of assessment.
Section 5.17 Master Association Statement at Transfer of Title. At the request of any Owner transferring title to such Owner's Lot or Condominium, the Master Association shall provide (i) a true statement in writing from an authorized representative of the Master Association as to the amount of the Master Association's current regular and special assessments and fees, as well as any assessments levied upon the Owner's Lot or Condominium which are unpaid on the date of the statement, and (ii) any change in the Master Association's current regular and special assessments and fees which have been approved by the Master Association's Board of Directors, but have not become due and payable as of the date disclosure is provided pursuant to this Section.
Section 5.18 Exemption from Assessments to Master Common Areas. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Master Declaration, Declarant, the Merchant Builders or any other Owner shall not be obligated to pay any portion of any assessments, which is for the purpose of defraying expenses and establishing reserves directly attributable to the existence and use of a Master Common Area improvement that is not complete at the time assessments commence. Any such exemption for the payment of assessments shall be in effect only until a Notice of Completion of the Master Common Area improvement has been recorded or the Master Common Area improvement has been placed into use, whichever shall first occur.

No construction or excavation shall be commenced in the Lake or Bank Areas until the plans have been approved in writing by the Architectural Control Committee, which can require an opinion by a soils engineer or other expert supporting the feasibility of the work for which the approval is requested and require that the Owner submitting plans pay the fee charged by such engineer or other expert. Such work may be disapproved or conditionally approved if it will impair the stability of any Bank Area or erosion control barrier of the Lake in the absence of adequate corrective measures.
7.6.6 Special Permission. Declarant may grant the right to build structures and dwellings in the Bank Area to purchasers from Declarant, provided the Deed or another recorded document referencing such Lake Lot executed by Declarant expressly sets forth the setback limitations for the Lake Lot, and the improvements are otherwise consistent with this Master Declaration.

Neither Declarant, the Merchant Builders, the Master Association, the Board or the architectural committee, or any subcommittees thereof, or the members or designated representatives thereof, shall be liable for damages to any Owner submitting plans or specifications to them for approval, or to any Owner in the Community affected by this Master Declaration by reason of mistake in judgment, negligence or nonfeasance, unless due to willful misconduct or bad faith of the architectural committee. The architectural committee's (or subcommittee's) approval or disapproval of a submission shall be based solely on the consideration set forth in this Article, and in such rules and regulations as may be promulgated by the architectural committee, and the architectural committee shall not be responsible for reviewing, nor shall its approval of any plan or design

8.2.1 No Lot or Condominium shall be occupied and used except for residential purposes by the Owners, their tenants, and social guests, and no trade or business shall be conducted therein, except that Declarant, its successors or assigns, may use any Lot(s) or Condominium(s) in the Community owned by Declarant or Merchant Builders for a model home site or sites and display and sales office, construction yard trailers, construction office, or placement of signs, until the last Lot or Condominium is sold by Declarant or a Merchant Builder.

However, the provisions of this Section shall not preclude professional and administrative occupations within the Community, or other reasonable business activity, which have no signs or other external evidence thereof, for so long as such occupations are in conformance with all applicable governmental ordinances, are merely incidental to the use of the Lot or Condominium as a residential home, do not cause any increase in the potential liability or casualty insurance premiums of the Master Association, and do not in any manner disturb other occupants or generate any pedestrian or vehicular traffic from clients, customers, employees, independent contractors, or deliveries or other form of nuisance.
8.2.3 Subject to California Civil Code Sections 712 and 713, no sign or billboard of any kind shall be displayed by any Owner on any portion of the Residential Area of the Community or Lot or Condominium, except one sign of reasonable size (not to exceed eighteen inches (18") by thirty inches (30")), advertising that the particular Lot or Condominium is for sale or rent, or except by Declarant or a Merchant Builder in connection with initial sales of the Lots or Condominiums, during the sales period set forth in Section 8.2.1, hereinabove, or except for one aesthetically acceptable (to the Architectural Control Committee) nameplate or similar Owner name identification, and one unobtrusive sign advertising the existence of a security service protecting the Lot or Condominium.

from the view of the adjoining Lots, Condominiums and streets, such as within a garage. No garage shall be used at any time for residential purposes or any purpose which would interfere in any manner with the availability and use of such garage for the purpose of automobile parking for the number of vehicles for which it was intended. The foregoing restriction shall not be deemed to prevent washing and polishing of such motor vehicle, boat, trailer, camper or motor-driven cycle, together with those activities normally incident and necessary to such washing and polishing.
8.2.6 No parking of vehicles, as defined by the California Vehicle Code, shall be permitted on any private streets within the Community except within areas designated for public parking by the Board, or, except within areas subject to a Sub-Association designated by the board of directors of such Sub-Association for public parking. Except as otherwise permitted by the Board or the board of a Sub-Association, residents of the Community shall park their motor vehicles only within their respective garages or carports. Temporary loading and unloading and guest parking within private driveways which are adequate for such purpose is permitted, except in common driveways where such use might obstruct access by others. Indefinite parking of any vehicle in any street or parking area, or on any driveway, shall be prohibited. "Indefinite parking" means the parking of a vehicle for a period in excess of seventy-two (72) hours. Parking of any vehicle in a driveway in such a manner as to encroach into or obstruct traffic along the sidewalk shall be prohibited.
8.2.7 An Owner may keep and maintain in his Residential Area Lot or Condominium domesticated pets such as dogs, cats or other usual and ordinary household pets, not to exceed two (2) in number and provided that such pets shall not be allowed in the Master Common Area or recreational areas except as may be permitted by the Rules and Regulations which may be promulgated from time to time by the Board. Except as hereinabove provided, no animals, livestock, birds or poultry shall be brought within the Community or kept in any Lot or Condominium thereof. Owners keeping pets shall be accountable to the other Owners for the acts of such pets, and should any Owner be unable to control barking or other noise or acts of his pets which disturb his neighbors, he shall be required to remove such pet from the Community. Each owner of a pet shall forthwith clean up and remove any animal waste such pet may deposit on the Master Common Area or the property of another Owner. No dog will be allowed on the Master Common Area or recreational areas without being restrained on a leash and being supervised. Any Owner (including such Owner's family, guests and invitees) who maintains any pet, animal, reptile, livestock or other living creature of any kind, within the Community, whether in compliance with this Master Declaration and the Rules and Regulations or otherwise, shall indemnify, defend and hold the Master Association harmless from and against any damages, claims, causes of action or losses of any kind or nature, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs, incurred by the Master Association as a result of any alleged damage or injury caused by such living creature to the Master Association, to its property, to the Master Common Area, or to the Members, their family, guests or invitees, or their property.

8.2.8.4 Each Owner of a pit bull shall maintain and provide to the Master Association evidence of a liability insurance policy of not less than $300,000.00 for bodily injury or death of any person, or damage to property, which may result from the ownership, keeping or maintenance of such pit bull. Proof of insurance shall be evidenced by the filing with the Master Association of a certificate of insurance from an insurance company authorized to do business in the State of California stating that the Owner is and will be insured against liability for such damages. The Master Association may require, in place of such evidence of insurance, a surety bond or a personal bond secured by sufficient assets to be posted.
8.2.9 The erection of basketball standards or fixed sports apparatus is prohibited, except as provided in this subsection. A single basketball standard affixed to the structure of a dwelling and located over or adjacent to the garage door(s) is permitted, as is a free standing standard located immediately adjacent to a house and located so a ball in normal play cannot strike a neighboring house or go into the street. Except as provided in the next sentence, a basketball standard may not be located more than three feet (3') from the wall of a residence including an attached garage. In addition, with the written approval of the Architectural Control Committee, a basketball standard may be allowed along the outside or inside curve of a curved driveway, provided it is set back from the street as far as the wall of the residence including attached garage which is closest to the street. No basketball standard is permitted to be located on or near a sidewalk or the street. A basketball standard must be maintained in good condition and repair. Any portable basketball standard must be stored out of sight of the street or neighboring residences except when it is being used for play.

No alteration to or modification of such fiber optics cable system as developed by Declarant and the Merchant Builders, shall be permitted without prior consent of the Board and the cable television operator. Owners are prohibited from installing any antenna on the exterior of a residence for any purpose, except for an "Authorized Antenna" which may be installed so long as the proposed location for such installation is reviewed and approved by the Architectural Control Committee prior to its installation in order to ensure that the visibility of the Authorized Antenna is minimized with respect to other Owners. The Architectural Control Committee may require that the location of the Authorized Antenna be moved, and the Board may impose additional restrictions on installation or use of an Authorized Antenna, so long as such review by the Architectural Control Committee, or such additional restrictions, do not (a) unreasonably delay or prevent installation, maintenance or use of an Authorized Antenna, (b) unreasonably increase the cost of installation, maintenance or use of an Authorized Antenna, or (c) preclude reception of an acceptable quality signal. The Board may prohibit the installation of an Authorized Antenna if the installation, location or maintenance of such Authorized Antenna unreasonably affects the safety of managers, agents or employees of the Master Association and other Owners, or for any other safety related reason established by the Board. The Board may also prohibit the installation of an Authorized Antenna on property to which an Owner does not hold fee title or is not entitled to exclusively use under this Master Declaration or a Sub-Association Declaration, or may allow an Owner to install an antenna other than an Authorized Antenna subject to the Architectural Guidelines and review and approval by the Architectural Control Committee. An "Authorized Antenna" means an antenna that is (a) designed to receive direct broadcast satellite service, including direct-to-home satellite service and that is one meter or less in diameter, and, (b) that is designed to receive video programming service, including multichannel multipoint distribution service, instructional television fixed service, and local multipoint distribution service, and that is one meter or less in diameter, or (c) an antenna that is designed to receive television broadcast signals.

Within such easements, no structure, planting or other materials shall be placed or permitted to remain which may damage or interfere with the installation and maintenance of utilities or which may change the direction of the flow of drainage channels, or which may obstruct or retard the flow of water through drainage channels in the easements. The easement area of each Lot or Condominium, if any, and all improvements therein, if any, shall be maintained continuously by the Owner of the Lot or Condominium, except for those improvements for which a public authority or a utility is responsible. In addition, all sewer pipelines and other sewer facilities located or to be located within public roads, streets and highways abutting each of the Lots and Condominiums are reserved.

8.2.17 Each grantee of a Lot or Condominium within the Community covenants for himself, his heirs, successors and assigns, that he will not in any way interfere with the established drainage patterns or create erosion or sliding problems over his Lot or Condominium from adjoining or other Lots or Condominiums within the Community, and that he will make adequate provisions for proper drainage in the event it is necessary to change the

Within slope areas no structure, planting, or other material shall be placed or permitted to remain or other activities undertaken which may damage or interfere with established slope ratios, create erosion or sliding problems, or which may change the direction of flow of drainage channels or obstruct or retard the flow of water through drainage channels. The slope areas of each Lot or Condominium and all improvements thereto shall be maintained continuously by the Owner of the Lot or Condominium, except for those improvements for which a public authority or utility company is responsible. Declarant or the seller Merchant Builder shall, for a period of one (1) year following sale and deed of any particular Lot or Condominium have the right but not the obligation to enter upon the said Lot or Condominium and alter or maintain the slope areas. An easement of reasonable access for said purpose is reserved to Declarant and the Merchant Builders, and the purchaser, by the acceptance of a deed from Declarant or a Merchant Builder, shall take title subject to such easement for said period of one (1) year.

Each Owner shall also be responsible for the maintenance and repair of the walks and the private driveways within such Owner's Lot, including the periodic structural repair, resurfacing, sealing, caulking, replacement and/or painting thereof. Each Owner shall also be responsible for the maintenance and repair of the yard drains for surface water runoff within such Owner's Lot, and the drainage lines for the same, and shall keep same free and clear of debris.

Section 10.2 Common Driveway Easements And Maintenance. Each Owner whose Lot or Condominium is served by a common driveway or alleyway (referred to herein as a "driveway", and being a private driveway or alleyway providing access to more than one Lot or Condominium and which crosses or is located in whole or in part on one or more adjacent Lots or Condominiums) is hereby granted a non-exclusive perpetual easement for ingress, egress, and access on, over and across such common driveway. Each Owner whose Lot or Condominium is served by a common driveway shall share the use thereof with all Owners and occupants of the other Lot(s) or Condominium(s) served by such common driveway. Under no circumstances shall any vehicle or other item or thing be allowed to remain in such common driveway the effect of which would be to block or otherwise prevent its usage by persons entitled to use the same. The Board may adopt rules applicable to common driveways including the assessment of charges to Owners and occupants who violate, or whose invitees violate, such rules. The Owners of all Lots or Condominiums sharing a common driveway shall share equally the costs of maintenance, repair and replacement of that portion of such common driveway located upon private Lots or Condominiums, as opposed to Master Common Area. The Board shall determine when any such maintenance, repair or replacement is required, and the affected Owners shall thereupon cause the same promptly to be accomplished; provided, however, that if such Owners fail to complete such work within sixty (60) days after such determination by the Board, the Board may cause the same to be accomplished and may levy special assessments to pay the costs thereof pro rata against each Owner of a Lot or Condominium served by such driveway or collect such costs in any other manner it deems appropriate.
Section 10.3 Required Periodic Maintenance. Except as otherwise provided in the Sub-Association Declaration encumbering such Lot or Condominium, each Owner shall cause the exterior of such Owner's residence to be maintained, painted, repaired, and/or replaced on a periodic basis calculated to preserve the utility, integrity and attractive appearance of the exterior elements of the residence, as provided herein. Roof shingles shall be replaced no less frequently than recommended by the manufacturer. Exterior walls, doors, facia, trim and balcony railings shall be repainted no less frequently than once every four (4) years, or as determined by the Board.

The Master Association shall be responsible for the repair and payment for all centrally metered utilities, water charges, and mechanical and electrical equipment in the Master Common Area; the repair and maintenance of all the debris systems located in the Properties; and the repair and maintenance of all walks, portions of private driveways and alleyways and other means of ingress and egress within the Master Common Area.

Community to be regularly inspected for any violations thereof. Declarant, with respect to its portion of the Community, and, in cooperation with Declarant, each Merchant Builder and each Sub-Association with respect to their portions of the Community, shall create and establish a maintenance program to be followed by the Master Association and the Sub-Associations to provide for and assure the continued integrity and aesthetics of the Community. The cost of any maintenance, repairs or replacement by the Master Association which is not the responsibility of the Master Association, or which arises out of, or is caused by, the act or negligence of an Owner, or such Owner's family, tenants, guests, invitees or agents shall, after notice and hearing, be levied by the Board as a Special Assessment against such Owner.
Section 10.8 Damage to Master Common Areas. In the event the need for repair of the Master Common Area is caused through the willful or negligent acts of a Member or his guests or invitees, the Master Association, or their agents or employees shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make such repairs and the liability of the Member and the cost of repair shall be assessed to that Member as a special assessment as set forth in this Master Declaration.
ARTICLE 11
INSURANCE
Section 11.1 Liability/Property Insurance. A master or blanket public liability and property damage insurance policy covering the Master Common Area shall be purchased by the Board of Directors as promptly as possible following its election and shall be maintained in force at all times, the premium thereon to be paid out of the monies collected from the assessments. The minimum amount of coverage shall be Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) combined single limit liability for bodily injury to any one person, or property damage for any one occurrence; if written on the new occurrence form, coverage shall be Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) in the aggregate and Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) per occurrence. The policy shall name the Master Association and all Owners as insureds, including Declarant and the Merchant Builders, during such time as Declarant or a Merchant Builder shall remain the Owner of one or more Lots or Condominiums. The Community Manager shall also be a named insured on such policy, during such time as his agency shall continue. The insurance shall also contain a cross-liability endorsement to cover negligent injury by one Owner to another, if reasonably available. The Master Association shall prepare and distribute to all Members a summary of the Master Association's property, general liability, and hazard insurance policies, which shall be distributed within sixty (60) days preceding the beginning of the Master Association's fiscal year, that includes all of the following information about each policy: (a) the name of the insurer, (b) the type of insurance, (c) the policy limits of the insurance, and (d) the amount of deductibles, if any. The Master Association shall, as soon as reasonably practical, notify the Members by first-class mail if any of the policies described in this paragraph have lapsed, been canceled, and are not immediately renewed, restored or replaced, or if there is a significant change, such as a reduction in coverage or limits or an increase in the deductible, for any of those policies. If the Master Association receives any notice of nonrenewal of a policy described in this paragraph, the Master Association shall immediately notify the Members if replacement coverage will not

be in effect by the date the existing coverage will lapse. To the extent that any of the information required to be disclosed pursuant to this paragraph is specified in the insurance policy declaration page, the Master Association may meet its obligation to disclose that information by making copies of that page and distributing it to all Members. The summary distributed pursuant to this paragraph shall contain in at least 10-point boldface type, the statement required by Civil Code Section 1365(0(4).
Section 11.2 Hazard Insurance. The Board of Directors shall purchase a master or blanket policy of all-risk or named peril (fire, extended coverage, vandalism and malicious mischief) insurance issued by a Qualified Insurer, as defined herein, providing coverage equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the current replacement cost of all Master Common Area improvements to the Community then subject to assessments under Article 5 of the Master Declaration (including all service and mechanical equipment in the Master Common Area). "Qualified Insurer" means any insurance company having a Best's Insurance Reports rating of (a) a B general policyholder's rating and a III financial size category, or (b) an A general policyholder's rating and a II financial size category, and licensed in the State of California. Said insurance policy shall contain an earthquake damage endorsement if the Board determines that coverage is reasonably necessary and reasonably available at a cost deemed to be in the best interests of the Members. Replacement cost may exclude land, foundations, excavation, and other items normally excluded from coverage. All hazard insurance required to be maintained by the Board hereunder shall be maintained to meet or exceed the requirements of the provisions contained in the FHLMC Seller/Servicer Guide, as recommended by the insurance agent for the Master Association. The premiums for said insurance policy shall be paid by the Board out of the monies collected from the assessments. The policy may also contain an agreed amount endorsement, a special form endorsement, and a clause to permit cash settlement covering the full value of the improvements in the event of partial destruction and a decision not to rebuild. The policy shall name as insureds all Owners and Declarant and the Merchant Builders, so long as Declarant or a Merchant Builder is the Owner of any Lot or Condominium within the Community, and all Mortgagees of record, as their respective interests may appear. The proportionate interest of each Owner in any insurance proceeds in relation to the other Owners, shall be based upon a ratio of each Lot's or Condominium's "fair market value" to the "fair market value" of the entire Community. The "fair market value" in both instances, shall be determined by an independent appraiser. In the event that the insurer under said hazard insurance policy shall cease to be licensed in the State of California, or shall cease to be approved by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (so long as insurers continue to be so approved), the Master Association shall exercise its best efforts to obtain from another Qualified Insurer, a replacement hazard policy comparable to the prior hazard policy, including all required endorsements.
11.2.1 Personal property of a Lot or Condominium Owner and additional fixtures added by a Lot or Condominium Owner should be insured separately by the Lot or Condominium Owner.

Section 11.3 Board as Trustee. All insurance proceeds payable pursuant to Section 11.2 of this Article and subject to the rights of Mortgagees under Section 11.6 hereof shall be paid to the lending institutions holding first Mortgages on Lots or Condominiums within the Community, to the extent of their interests therein, and shall be applied only to the repair and restoration of the damaged premises or to the reduction of the aggregate principal amounts of the mortgage loans secured by such damaged or destroyed premises.

In the event repair or reconstruction is authorized, the Board shall have the duty to contract for such work, as provided in Article 12 hereof.
Section 11.4 Other Insurance. The Board may purchase and maintain in force at all times, demolition insurance in adequate amounts to cover demolition in the event of destruction and a decision not to rebuild.

The Board of Directors shall also purchase and maintain Worker's Compensation Insurance to the extent that the same shall be required by law for employees of the Master Association. The Board of Directors may also purchase and maintain insurance on commonly owned personal property and such other insurance as it deems necessary, the premium thereof to be paid out of the monies collected from the assessments, including, but not limited to, umbrella or excess liability coverage.
Section 11.5 Owners' Other Insurance. An Owner may carry such additional personal liability and property damage insurance respecting individual Lots or Condominiums as he may desire.
Section 11.6 Right of Mortgagees. With respect to insurance coverage under Section 11.2 hereof, any Mortgagee of record shall have the option to apply insurance proceeds payable to it to reduce the obligation secured by the Mortgage, but only in the event that the insured has determined not to rebuild.
Section 11.7 Annual Review. The Board shall review the insurance carried by the Master Association at least annually for the purpose of determining the amount of the casualty and property insurance referred to in Section 11.1 above. The Board shall obtain current appraisal of the full replacement value of the improvements in the Master Common Area, except for foundations and footings, without deduction for depreciation, by a qualified appraiser, prior to each such annual review.

be promptly repaired and rebuilt, unless, within ninety (90) days from the date of such destruction, Delegates representing seventy-five (75%) percent of each class of membership present and entitled to vote in person or by proxy, at a duly constituted meeting, determine that such reconstruction shall not take place. If reconstruction is to take place, the Board of Directors shall be required to execute, acknowledge, file and record, not later than one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of said destruction, a certificate declaring the intention of the Master Association to rebuild.
Section 12.2 Proceeds Less Than Eighty-Five Percent (85%) of Cost to Repair. If the proceeds of such insurance are less than eighty-five (85%) percent of the cost of reconstruction, such reconstruction may, nevertheless, take place, if within ninety (90) days from the date of said destruction, Delegates representing at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of each class of membership elect to rebuild.
Section 12.3 Additional Contributions From Owner. If the Master Association determines to rebuild, pursuant to either Sections 12.1 or 12.2, each Owner shall be obligated to contribute such funds as shall be necessary to pay his proportionate share of the cost of reconstruction over and above the insurance proceeds, and the proportionate share of each Owner shall be based upon the ratio of the fair market value of his Lot or Condominium to the fair market value of all the Lots and Condominiums. In the event of failure or refusal by any Owner to pay his proportionate share, after notice to him, should such failure or refusal continue for a period of sixty (60) days, the Board of Directors may levy a special assessment against such Owner, which may be enforced under the lien provisions, hereinbefore contained.
Section 12.4 Master Association to Contract for Rebuilding. If the Owners determine to rebuild, the Board of Directors shall obtain bids from at least two (2) reputable contractors and shall award construction work to the most qualified bidder. The Board of Directors shall have the authority to enter into a written contract with said contractor for such reconstruction and the insurance proceeds held by the Board shall be disbursed to said contractor according to the terms of the contract. It shall be the obligation of the Board to take all steps necessary to insure the commencement and completion of such reconstruction at the earliest possible date.
Section 12.5 Insufficient \Tote to Rebuild. If the vote of the Owners shall be insufficient to authorize rebuilding, either pursuant to Sections 12.1 or 12.2 above, the following shall apply:
12.5.1 Any insurance proceeds available for such rebuilding shall be distributed among the Owners and their individual lenders by the Board, as their respective interests may appear. The proportionate interests of each Owner in said proceeds in relation to other Owners shall be based upon a ratio of each Lot's and Condominium's "fair market value," just prior to destruction. "Fairmarket value" shall be determined by an independent appraiser.
12.5.2 The Board shall have the duty, within one hundred twenty (120) days of the date of such loss, to execute, acknowledge and record a certificate setting forth the determination of the Master Association not to rebuild, and shall promptly cause to be prepared and filed, such

Section 12.6 Revival of Right to Partition. Upon recordation of such certificate, referred to in Section 12.5.2, above, the right of any Owner to partition his Lot or Condominium through legal action, shall forthwith revive.
Section 12.7 Arbitration. In the event of a dispute among the Owners, with respect to the provisions of this Article, any Owner may cause the same to be referred to arbitration in accordance with the then prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association. In the event of arbitration, notice thereof shall be given to the Members of the Board and all Owners as promptly as possible after reference to arbitration is made, giving all Owners an opportunity to appear in such arbitration proceedings. The decision of such arbitrator in this matter shall be final and condusive upon all Owners.

MORTGAGEE PROTECTION
Section 13.1 Mortgagee Protection. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Master Declaration to the contrary, in order to induce lenders and investors to participate in the financing of the sale of Lots and Condominiums in the Community, the following provisions are added hereto (and to the extent these added provisions conflict with any other provisions in this Master Declaration, these added provisions shall control):
13.1.1 No breach of any of the covenants, conditions and restrictions herein contained, nor the enforcement of any lien provisions herein, shall defeat or render invalid the lien of any first Mortgage (meaning a Mortgage with first priority over any other Mortgage) on any Lot or Condominium made in good faith and for value, but all of said covenants, conditions and restrictions shall be binding upon and effective against any Owner whose title is derived through foreclosure or trustee's sale, or otherwise.
13.1.2 Each holder of a first Mortgage encumbering any Lot or Condominium is entitled upon request to timely written notification from the Master Association of any default by the Mortgagor of such Lot or Condominium in the performance of such Mortgagor's obligations under this Master Declaration, the Bylaws or Rules and Regulations of the Master Association which is not cured within sixty (60) days. Any Institutional Lender holding a first Mortgage on any Lot or Condominium within the Community shall be entitled to prior written notice of certain proposed actions of the Master Association as hereinafter set forth in Sections 13.1.5.1 through 13.1.5.7, inclusive, provided that such Institutional Lender furnishes the Master Association with a written request for notice which request sets forth the particular Institutional Lender's mailing address and identifies the Lot or Condominium on which it holds an encumbrance.

13.1.3 Each holder of a first Mortgage encumbering any Lot or Condominium which obtains title to such Lot or Condominium pursuant to: (a) remedies provided in such Mortgage, or (b) by accepting a deed (or assignment) in lieu of foreclosure in the event of default by a Mortgagor, shall be exempt from any "right of first refusal," if any, contained in the Master Declaration or the Bylaws of the Master Association. Further, any such "right of first refusal" shall not impair the rights of a first Mortgagee or interfere with a subsequent sale or lease of a Lot or Condominium so acquired by the Mortgagee.
13.1.4 Each holder of a first Mortgage or third party foreclosure purchaser which obtains title to a Lot or Condominium pursuant to foreclosure of the first Mortgage, shall take the Lot or Condominium free of any claim for unpaid dues, assessments or charges against the Lot or Condominium which accrue prior to the time such holder obtains title to such Lot or Condominium (except for claims for a share of such assessments or charges resulting from a reallocation of such dues, assessments or charges among all Lots and Condominiums, including the mortgaged Lot or Condominium). The lien assessments provided for herein shall be subordinate to the lien of any first Mortgage now or hereafter placed upon a Lot or Condominium subject to assessment; provided, however, that such subordination shall apply only to assessments which have become due and payable prior to a sale or transfer of such Lot or Condominium pursuant to a decree of foreclosure or trustee sale. Such sale or transfer shall not release such Lot or Condominium from liability for any assessments thereafter becoming due, nor from the lien of any such subsequent assessment.
13.1.5 Unless at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Institutional Lenders holding a first Mortgage on a Lot or Condominium within the Community (based upon one vote for each first Mortgage owned), or Delegates representing at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Owners (other than the Declarant and the Merchant Builders) have given their prior written approval, the Master Association and its Members shall not be entitled to:

13.1.7 The annual assessments shall include an adequate reserve fund for maintenance, repair and replacement of the improvements to the Master Common Area and those portions thereof that must be replaced on a periodic basis, and shall be payable in annual assessments rather than by special assessments.
13.1.8 All taxes, assessments and charges which may become liens prior to the first Mortgage under local law shall relate only to individual Lots and Condominiums, and not to the Community as a whole.
13.1.9 In the event of substantial damage to or destruction of any Lot or Condominium or any element of the Master Common Area or possible condemnation or eminent domain procedure, the Institutional Lender under any first Mortgage on a Lot or Condominium is entitled to timely written notice of any such damage, destruction or proposed acquisition and no provision in the Bylaws, nor in this Master Declaration shall be interpreted to entitle any Owner or any other party to priority over any first Mortgagee with respect to the distribution to such Owner of any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards for losses to, or a taking of, Lots, Condominiums and/or Master Common Areas.
13.1.10 Any agreement for professional management of the Community, or any other contract providing for services by the Declarant or a Merchant Builder shall provide for termination by either party without cause or payment of a termination fee upon thirty (30) days'

13.1.12 No breach of any of the foregoing covenants shall cause any forfeiture of title or reversion or bestow any right of re-entry whatsoever, but in the event that any one or more of these covenants shall be violated, the Declarant, its successors and assigns, the Merchant Builders, or the Master Association, or any Owner may commence a legal action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin or abate said violation, and/or to recover damages; provided, that any such violation shall not defeat or render invalid the lien of any Mortgage made in good faith and for value as to said Lot or Condominium or any part thereof. Said covenants shall be binding upon and effective against any Owner whose title is acquired by foreclosure, trustee's sale or otherwise.
13.1.13 First Mortgagees of Lots or Condominiums may, jointly or singly, pay taxes or other charges which are in default and which may or have become a charge against any Master Common Area and may pay overdue premiums on hazard insurance policies, or secure new hazard insurance coverage on the lapse of a policy, for such Master Common Area and first Mortgagees making such payments shall be owed immediate reimbursement therefor from the Master Association. This provision shall constitute an agreement by the Master Association for the express benefit of all first Mortgagees and upon request of any first Mortgagee the Master Association shall execute and deliver to such first Mortgagee a separate written Agreement embodying this provision.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.3.4 below (matters requiring the vote of only a majority of a quorum of Members), Delegates shall cast the votes "for" and "against" any matter voted upon by the Members they represent in the same manner and proportion as such votes were cast by such Members, but shall be free to exercise their independent discretion as to how to vote any Absentee Votes (defined below). In order that the business of the Master Association not be hindered by lack of a quorum, the Delegates shall in all cases cast all the votes to which the Members they represent are entitled, regardless of whether such votes were actually cast by such Members or are Absentee Votes. Delegates may only act personally at a meeting of the Delegates of the Master Association or by written ballot, and may not act by proxy. If a Delegate ("Absent Delegate") is not present at a duly called meeting of the Delegates, then the alternate for such Absent Delegate may attend the meeting and exercise all rights, powers and votes to which the Absent Delegate would be entitled. If the Absent Delegate should arrive prior to the adjournment of any such meeting, the alternate shall no longer be entitled to act in the place of the Absent Delegate; provided that such relinquishment of authority by the alternate shall not invalidate any matter previously voted or acted upon by the alternate in his temporary capacity as Delegate.
4.3.3.1 Special Groups. Where the votes of a special group of Members are required, such as Lake Lot Owners or Members other than Declarant, each Delegate shall segregate the votes of the members of such special group separately from other Members, and cast the votes of such group separately as though such votes were cast in a separate election at which only such group was voting. If a Delegate is casting votes for more than one (1) of such groups, the Delegate shall segregate the votes cast for each such group.
4.3.3.2 Delegate Qualifications. Delegates must be (a) an authorized agent or employee of Declarant, or (b) a Member of the Master Association in good standing. If the Member is a corporation, partnership, or other such entity, the authorized agent of such corporation, partnership or other entity shall be eligible for election as a Delegate, but may serve in such capacity only until such authorized agency is terminated. With the exception of Delegates who are agents or employees of Declarant, upon termination of any Delegate's membership in the Master Association, such Delegate shall be disqualified from serving the

remainder of his term as Delegate, and the position of Delegate for such Delegate District shall be deemed vacant.
4.3.3.3 Delegate Terms. Each Delegate shall serve a term of one (1) year (except that Delegates who hold such position by being officers of a Sub-Association serve for a period equal to the term of such office). The office of a Delegate shall be deemed vacant upon the death, resignation, removal or judicial adjudication of mental incompetence of the Delegate, or upon the Delegate's failure to satisfy all of the qualifications of Delegates as specified in the foregoing Section, or in case the Members in any Delegate District fail to elect a Delegate. Delegate vacancies caused by any reason other than the removal of a Delegate shall first be filled by the alternate Delegate, and if there is no alternate Delegate, by a special election within the Delegate District which shall be called and conducted by the Board either upon its own motion or upon receipt of a petition for such election signed by at least five percent (5%) of the Members within such Delegate District. Subject to the eligibility and vacancy provisions herein, each such person shall serve the remainder of the unexpired term of office of the predecessor Delegate, or until a successor is elected at a meeting of the Members in such Delegate District.
4.3.3.4 Removal of Delegates. A Delegate may be removed without cause by the vote in person or by proxy of a majority of a quorum of Members in a Delegate District, cast at any duly held meeting; provided, that in no event shall a Delegate be removed unless that votes cast in favor of such removal equal at least the lesser of: (a) the number of votes which elected such Delegate to his current term, or (b) a majority of the total voting power of the Members in such Delegate District.
4.3.4 Allocation of Delegate Votes. Whenever a matter which this Master Declaration requires to be approved by the vote of Delegates representing a majority or other specified percentage of the total voting power of the Master Association (i.e., excluding matters requiring a mere majority of a quorum of Delegates as delmed in the Bylaws, and excluding the election of Directors by the Class C Members) is presented to the Delegates for approval, written notice of the substance of such matter shall be given to the Delegates at least sixty (60) days prior to the date on which such matter is scheduled to be discussed at a meeting of the Delegates. During such sixty (60) day period, the Delegates shall submit such matter to a vote of the Members within their respective Delegate Districts. When voting on any such specified matter, each Delegate shall cast all of the votes which he represents as follows:
4.3.4.1 The Delegate shall cast votes attributable to Owners actually voting (whether in person, by proxy or written ballot) in such Delegate District "for" or "against" such specified matter in the same manner and proportion as such votes were cast by the voting Owners;
4.3.4.2 The Delegate shall cast votes attributable to Members within the Delegate District who have not voted on such specified matter ("Absentee Votes") as follows:

(a) If fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the votes in the Delegate District attributable to Owners other than Declarant have been cast pursuant to paragraph 4.3.4.1 above, then any Absentee Votes attributable to Owners other than Declarant shall be cast "for" or "against" the specified matter in the same proportion as the votes actually cast by the Owners other than Declarant pursuant to paragraph 4.3.4.1 above.
(b) If less than fifty-one percent (51%) of the votes in the Delegate District attributable to Owners other than Declarant have been cast pursuant to paragraph 4.3.4.1 above, then the Absentee Votes attributable to Owners other than Declarant shall be voted "for" or "against" the specified matter in such proportions as the Delegate shall, in his or her sole discretion, determine to be appropriate.
(c) Absentee Votes cast on behalf of Declarant shall be cast in the same proportion as the votes actually cast by Declarant.
4.3.5 Voting Reports. In order to verify compliance with the foregoing voting requirements, each ballot cast by a Delegate shall contain such Delegate's certification of the following information: (a) the total number and classification of votes in the Delegate District; (b) the total number and classification of votes cast "for" and "against" the specified matter on behalf of Declarant in response to instructions given pursuant to paragraph 4.3.4.1; (c) the total number of votes cast "for" and "against" the specified matter on behalf of Members other than Declarant in response to instructions given pursuant to Section 4.3.4.1; (d) the total number and classification of Absentee Votes in such Delegate District attributable to Declarant and the total number of Absentee Votes attributable to Members other than Declarant; and (e) the total number and classification of votes cast by such Delegate "for" and "against" the specified matter. The inspector of election shall tabulate the total number and classification of votes cast by all Delegates in each of the foregoing categories in order to determine whether the necessary approvals have been obtained. It will be conclusively presumed for all purposes of Master Association business that each Delegate casting votes on behalf of the Owners of Lots or Condominiums in his Delegate District will have acted with the authority and consent of all such Owners. All agreements and determinations lawfully made by the Master Association in accordance with the voting procedures established herein, and in the Bylaws, shall be deemed to be binding upon all Members, Owners and their respective successors and assigns.
4.3.6 Meetings of the membership of the Master Association shall be conducted in accordance with a recognized system of parliamentary procedure or such parliamentary procedures as the Master Association may adopt. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, notice of meetings of the Delegates shall specify those matters the Board intends to present for action by the Members but, except as otherwise provided by Law, any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for action. Members of the Master Association shall have access to Master Association records in accordance with Article 3 (commencing with Section 8330) of Chapter 13 of Part 3 of Division 2 of Title 1 of the Corporations Code.

The assessments collected for the payment of Club Charges shall be applied exclusively to that purpose. The portion of assessments levied to pay the costs related to Cost Center(s) shall be used exclusively for the purposes for which they were levied.
Section 5.3 Maximum Annual Assessment and Maximum Annual Club Charges. The Board of Directors shall abide by the hereinafter provisions for establishing the maximum annual assessments and maximum Club Charge assessments.
5.3.1	Until the first day of the fiscal year immediately following the conveyance of the first Residential Area Lot or Condominium in a Phase to an Owner, or until an earlier sale of the first Residential Area Lot or Condominium in a new Phase of the Community, the maximum annual assessment for each Residential Area Lot or Condominium in the Properties shall be as provided for in the budget approved by the California Department of Real Estate and disclosed in the Final Subdivision Public Report, for the particular Phase of the Community in which such sale occurred, and any amendments thereto. The Master Association shall maintain an adequate reserve fund for maintenance, repairs and replacement of those elements of the Master Common Area that must be replaced on a periodic basis, and such reserve shall be funded by annual assessments. In addition, the Master Association shall maintain adequate Cost Center reserve funds, with a separate fund for each identified Cost Center, for the maintenance, repairs and replacement of the Cost Centers, and such reserve shall be funded by annual Cost Center assessments levied only against Lots or Condominiums having special benefit from the respective Cost Centers within the Community, in accordance with the amounts therefor contained in the approved Cost Center Budgets.
5.3.2 From and after the first day of the fiscal year immediately following the conveyance of the first Residential Area Lot or Condominium to an Owner in a Phase, the maximum annual assessment may be increased effective the first day of each fiscal year by the Board without a vote of the membership, provided that (i) any such increase shall not be more than twenty percent (20%) of the previous year's most recent assessment level (including any increase in such assessment resulting from new Phases being annexed to the Properties during such year), and (ii) the Board of Directors has complied with Section 6.2 below with respect to that fiscal year, including, but not limited to, the preparation and distribution of a pro forma operating budget to all members of the Master Association as provided in Section 6.2 below, or has obtained the approval of Delegates representing a majority of the votes of Members at a meeting of Delegates at which more than fifty percent (50%) of the Members subject to such assessments are represented.

5.3.3 From and after the first day of the fiscal year immediately following the conveyance of the first Residential Area Lot or Condominium in a Phase to an Owner, the maximum annual assessment may be increased by the Board in an amount above the amount provided in subparagraph 5.3.1 by the vote or written assent of Delegates representing at least a majority of Owners in the Master Association constituting a quorum (as defined below), provided that the Board of Directors has prepared and distributed a pro forma operating budget to all members of the Master Association as provided in Section 6.2 below. For purposes of this Article 5, "quorum" means more than fifty percent (50%) of the Owners of the Master Association applied separately with respect to each Delegate District whose votes are represented. The Master Association shall provide notice by first-class mail to each Owner of any increase in the regular assessments of the Master Association, not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the increased assessment becoming due. Increases resulting from annexation of an additional Phase, the approved budget for which contains a higher maximum annual assessment amount than that in effect prior to such annexation, are not subject to this limitation.

5.3.5 The Board of Directors may fix the annual assessment at an amount not in excess of the maximum.
5.3.6 The restrictions on increases in assessments contained in this Section 5.3 shall be applied separately to the annual assessments applicable to all Lots and Condominiums, and to each of the separate Cost Centers applicable only to a particular group of Lots or Condominiums subject to Cost Center assessments. Increases in the Cost Center assessments, for each separate Cost Center, above the stated limits shall require the approving vote or written consent of a majority of a quorum of the Members subject to Cost Center assessments for the particular Cost Center for which an increase is proposed, in accordance with the procedures of this Article as applied to such Members.
5.3.7 With specific reference to the Club Charge, the initial Club Operating Budget (which shall consist of a separate budget for The Club, or those items of cost designated as costs of The Club in the Budget approved by the California Department of Real Estate for Phase 1 of the Community) shall become effective and operative on the later of (a) date of filing of a Notice of Completion for The Club At Westlake, and (b) the close of escrow for the sale of the first Residential Area Lot to an Owner, and the assessment of Club Charges shall also commence as of such date. Thereafter, the monthly Club Charge assessed per Residential Area Lot or per Condominium shall be as established by the Operator in accordance with the Operator Agreement and disclosed in the Final Subdivision Public Report, for the particular Phase of the Community, and any amendments thereto, and in accordance with the Club Operating Budgets in effect from time to time.

5.3.9 The Declarant and Merchant Builders shall be exempt from the payment of that portion of assessments designated for payment of the Budget Line Item for cable TV services. The line item assessments for cable TV services shall only be assessed to end user Owners. During the period of time prior to the commencement of assessments under the approved budget for Phase 1 of the Community, Owners will be separately charged the monthly amount for the cable TV services by the provider thereof. After commencement of assessments under said initial budget, the cost of cable TV services will be collected by the Master Association.
Section 5.4 Special Assessments. In addition to the annual assessments authorized above, the Master Association may levy, in any assessment year, a special assessment applicable to that year only for the purpose of defraying, in whole or in part, the cost of any construction, reconstruction, repair or replacement of a capital improvement upon the Master Common Area, including fixtures and personal property related thereto, or otherwise, provided that any such assessment for capital improvements to the Master Common Area which total more than five percent (5%) of the budgeted gross expenses of the Master Association for that fiscal year shall have the vote or written assent of Delegates representing a majority of the Owners constituting a quorum; and, further provided, that any such assessment for capital improvements to the Cost Center within any Delegate District, which total more than five percent (5%) of the budgeted gross expenses of the Master Association with respect to such Cost Center for that fiscal year, shall have the vote or written assent of a majority of the Owners within the affected Delegate District constituting a quorum. The Master Association may also levy a special assessment against any Member to reimburse the Master Association for costs incurred in bringing the Member and his Residential Area Lot or Condominium into compliance with the provisions of the Master Declaration, any amendments thereto, the Articles, the Bylaws, and the Rules and Regulations, which special assessment may be levied upon the vote of the Board after notice and an opportunity for a hearing which satisfy the requirements of Section 7341 of the California Corporations Code, as set forth in the Bylaws.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, those Residential Area Lots and Condominiums which receive special benefit from a Cost Center, as designated in a Notice of Annexation, shall also be subject to Cost Center assessments to reimburse the Master Association for the cost of periodic inspection, maintenance, replacement and repair, and accumulation of reserves, for the applicable Cost Center(s), in accordance with the amounts stated for such costs in the approved Cost Center Budgets for the Community. Club Charges shall be assessed in accordance with the Club Charges determined annually by the Operator of The Club. The obligation to pay Club Charges with respect to all persons using facilities or receiving services of The Club based upon the membership of an Owner shall be that of such Owner.
Section 5.7 Date of Commencement of Annual Assessments; Due Dates. The annual assessments provided for herein shall commence as to all Residential Area Lots or Condominiums in the first Phase of the Community on the date of close of escrow for the sale of the first Residential Area Lot or Condominium to an Owner.

sale of the first Residential Area Lot or Condominium in such Phase to an Owner. The due dates for assessments shall be established by the Board of Directors. If any payment of an assessment installment is less than the amount assessed and the payment does not specify the assessment fund or account into which it is to be deposited, it shall first be applied to pay general annual assessments for operating costs until the amount due therefor is satisfied, then to pay the Cost Center operating cost assessment (if any) due from such Owner until the amount due therefor is satisfied, then to pay the general reserve fund until the amount due therefor is satisfied, and, any remaining amount shall be applied to pay the reserve fund for the Cost Center for which such Owner is responsible.
Section 5.8 Commencement Of Club Charge Assessments. Monthly Club Charge assessments shall commence as to any Lot or Condominium owned by a Merchant Builder, Declarant or any other Owner, on the date on which such Lot or Condominium is annexed to the Master Association; provided, however, that Club Charge assessments shall not commence as to any Lot or Condominium until the date on which a Notice of Completion is filed for The Club. Club Charge assessments are due and payable in the same manner and at the same times as monthly installments of annual assessments, and the same collection and enforcement procedures apply. Amounts received on account of Club Charge Assessments shall be applied in the following order of priority: (1) to payment of interest due under the Lease-Purchase Agreement; (2) payment of Club Operating Costs; (3) to accumulation of required reserves; (4) payment of the Club Operator's Management Fee; and (5) payment of principal due under the Lease-Purchase Agreement.
Section 5.9 Non-Member Area Payments.
5.9.1 Establishment of Non-Member Area Payments. At least thirty (30) days prior to the start of each Fiscal Year, or the start of any partial fiscal year, the Master Association shall estimate and establish the costs and expense for the maintenance of the water quantity and quality of the Lake, including, but not limited to: (i) costs for the supply of water to and from the Lake induding pumping equipment, pipes, gates and valves; and (ii) maintenance of the Lake water quality, including application of chemicals, use of any other water quality control system, and the costs of any fountains in the Lake maintained by the Master Association. The appropriate portion of the amounts so established shall be assessed as a "Non-Member Area Assessment" against the Lots within the Non-Member Areas based upon the ratio that the aggregate number of acres in the Non-Member Areas, calculated to the tenth of an acre, bears to 331.2 acres minus the acreage occupied by the Lake, the Recreational Facility, and any public park, public school site, or other publicly owned real property, located within such area. 331.2 acres is the entire area using the Lake for storm water drainage. This area is identical to the area that is originally subject to this Declaration plus the Lane and the area that is subject to Annexation by the Declarant. The assessment shall be payable at such time and in such installments as the Board may designate. The aggregate Non-Member Area Assessment shall be allocated to and levied against the Lots within the respective portions of the Non-Member Areas as follows, subject to the power and authority of the Board, in its sole and absolute

assessment is not paid within thirty (30) days after the date said assessment is due, the assessment shall bear interest from the due date at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum. The Master Association may bring an action at law against the Owner personally obligated to pay same, and in addition thereto, or in lieu thereof, after the expiration of thirty (30) days following recordation thereof, may foredose the lien provided herein below against the Lot or Condominium.
5.10.1 Any assessment not received by the Master Association within fifteen (15) days after the due date shall be delinquent. Before the Master Association may place a lien upon the Lot or Condominium of an Owner as provided herein, the Master Association shall notify such Owner in writing by certified mail of the fee and penalty procedures of the Master Association, provide an itemized statement which indicates the principal amount owed, any late charges and the method of calculation, any attorney's fees, and the collection practices used by the Master Association, including the right of the Master Association to the reasonable costs of collection. The amount of any such delinquent assessment or installment, together with any accompanying late charges, interest, costs (induding reasonable attorneys' fees), and penalties, as provided for in this Master Declaration, shall be and become a lien on the Lot or Condominium against which the assessment is levied when the Master Association causes to be recorded a Notice of Delinquent Assessment (herein the "Notice") in the office of the County Recorder of the County in which the Lot or Condominium is located. The Notice shall describe the amount of such delinquent assessment or installment and such other charges thereon as may be authorized by this Master Declaration, a legal description of the Lot or Condominium against which the same has been assessed, the name of the Owner, and, if the lien is to be enforced by the power of sale under nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings, the name and address of the trustee authorized by the Master Association to enforce the lien by sale. Such Notice shall be signed by the president or vice-president, and the secretary or assistant secretary of the Master Association or any employee or agent of the Master Association authorized to do so by the Board and shall be mailed in the manner set forth in Civil Code Section 2924b to all record owners of the Owner's interest in the Lot or Condominium no later than ten (10) calendar days after recordation. Unless the Board considers the immediate recording of the Notice to be in the best interests of the Master Association, the Notice shall not be recorded until fifteen (15) calendar days after the Master Association has delivered the above-described required written notice of default. Any payments received by the Master Association on account of such a debt shall first be applied to the principal amount owed, and only after the principal amount owed is paid in full shall such payments be applied to interest or collection expenses If the delinquent assessment or installment and related charges are paid or otherwise satisfied, the Master Association shall record a notice of satisfaction and release of lien.
5.10.2 The Board may, after the expiration of thirty (30) days following recordation thereof, enforce any assessment lien provided for in Section 5.9 hereinabove, by filing an action for judicial foreclosure or, if the Notice contained the name and address of the trustee authorized by the Master Association to enforce the lien by nonjudicial foreclosure, by recording a notice of default in the form described in Civil Code Section 2924c(b)(1) to commence a nonjudicial foreclosure. Any nonjudicial foreclosure shall be conducted in accordance with the

requirements of Civil Code Sections 2924, 2924b, 2924c, 2924f, 2924g, and 2924h that apply to nonjudicial foreclosures of Mortgages or deeds of trust. The sale shall be conducted by the trustee named in the Notice of Delinquent Assessment or by a trustee substituted in accordance with the provisions of the California Civil Code. The Master Association may bid on the Lot or Condominium at the sale, and may hold, lease, mortgage, and convey the acquired Lot or Condominium. If the default is cured before the sale, or before completing a judicial foreclosure, induding payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Master Association, the Master Association shall record a Notice of Satisfaction and Release of Lien, and on receipt of a written request by the Owner, a Notice of Rescission of the Master Declaration of Default and Demand for Sale. Suit to recover a money judgment for unpaid assessments, rent and attorneys' fees shall be maintainable without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing the same.
5.10.3 A monetary penalty imposed by the Association as a disciplinary measure for (a) failure of an Owner to comply with this Declaration, and the Articles, Bylaws or Rules and Regulations of the Association, or (b) as a means of reimbursing the Association for costs incurred by the Association in the repair of damages to the Common Area and facilities for which the Owner or the Owner's guests or tenants is allegedly responsible, or (c) to bring an Owner or its Lot into compliance with this Declaration, and the Articles, Bylaws or Rules and Regulations of the Association shall not be treated as an assessment which may become a lien against the Owner's Lot enforceable by a sale of the Lot in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2924, 2924b and 2924c of the California Civil Code. This Section shall not apply to charges imposed against an Owner which are reasonable late payment penalties for delinquent assessments nor charges to reimburse the Master Association for the loss of interest and for costs reasonably incurred (including attorneys' fees) in its efforts to collect delinquent assessments.
5.10.4 In addition to the lien power described hereinabove, each Owner vests in the Master Association or its assigns, the right and power to bring all actions at law against such Owner or other Owners for the collection of delinquent assessments. In lieu of bringing an action at law to collect delinquent assessments, the Master Association may submit the matter to arbitration pursuant to the Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The decision of the arbitrator on such delinquent assessment shall be binding on both the Master Association and the delinquent Owner and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The fee to initiate such arbitration shall be paid by the Master Association and shall be recoverable as part of the arbitration award, in addition to the late charges and interest on the delinquent assessment as provided above.
Section 5.11 Policies for Assessment Collection. The Board of Directors shall annually distribute within sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of the fiscal year a statement of the Master Association's policies and practices for enforcing its remedies against Members for defaults in the payment of annual and special assessments, including the recording and foreclosing of liens against Members' Lots and Condominiums.

Section 5.12 Subordination of the Lien to First Deeds of Trust and First Mortgages. The lien for the assessments provided for herein shall be subordinate to the lien of any first Mortgage upon any Lot or Condominium. Sale or transfer of any Lot or Condominium shall not affect the assessment lien. However, the sale or transfer of any Lot or Condominium pursuant to judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure of a first Mortgage or any conveyance in lieu thereof shall extinguish the lien of such assessments as to payments which became due prior to such sale or transfer. No sale or transfer shall relieve such Lot or Condominium from lien rights for any assessments thereafter becoming due. Where the Mortgagee of a first Mortgage of Record or other purchaser of a Lot or Condominium obtains title to the same as a result of foreclosure or conveyance in lieu thereof, such acquirer of title, his successors and assigns, shall not be liable for the share of the common expenses or assessments by the Master Association chargeable to such Lot or Condominium which became due prior to the acquisition of title to such Lot or Condominium by such acquirer. Such unpaid share of common expenses or assessments shall be deemed to be common expenses collectible from all of the Lots and Condominiums including such acquirer, his successors and assigns.
Section 5.13 Estoppel Certificate. The A/aster Association shall furnish or cause an appropriate officer to furnish, upon demand by any person, a certificate signed by an officer of the Master Association setting forth whether the assessments on a specified Lot or Condominium have been paid.

Section 5.14 Personal Liability of Owner. No Owner may exempt himself from personal liability for assessments, nor any part thereof (including the charges for cable television service), levied by the Master Association, nor release the Lot or Condominium owned by him from the liens and charges hereof by waiver of the use and enjoyment of the Master Common Area and facilities thereon, or by abandonment of his Lot or Condominium. Similarly, no Member may exempt himself from personal liability for payment of Club Charge assessments levied by the Master Association, nor release the Lot or Condominium owned by him from the liens and charges thereof by waiver of the use and enjoyment of facilities and services of The Club, or because of non-use or abandonment of such Member's Lot or Condominium.
Section 5.15 Exempt Property. All Properties dedicated to and accepted by a local public authority, and all Properties owned by a charitable nonprofit organization exempt from taxation by the laws of the State of California, shall be exempt from the assessments created herein. However, no real property or improvements devoted to dwelling use shall be exempt from said assessments.

Section 5.17 Master Association Statement at Transfer of Title. At the request of any Owner transferring title to such Owner's Lot or Condominium, the Master Association shall provide (i) a true statement in writing from an authorized representative of the Master Association as to the amount of the Master Association's current regular and special assessments and fees, as well as any assessments levied upon the Owner's Lot or Condominium which are unpaid on the date of the statement, and (ii) any change in the Master Association's current regular and special assessments and fees which have been approved by the Master Association's Board of Directors, but have not become due and payable as of the date disclosure is provided pursuant to this Section.

(a) may authorize the temporary transfer of money from the general reserve account, but not the Cost Center reserve accounts or the Lake Reserve Fund, to the Master Association's operating account to meet short term cash flow requirements or other expenses, provided that the Board has made a written finding, recorded in the Board's minutes, explaining the reasons that the transfer is needed, and describing when and how the money will be repaid to the reserve account.
(b) shall cause the transferred funds to be restored to the reserve account within one (1) year of the date of initial transfer; however, the governing body may, upon making a documented finding that a temporary delay of restoration of the funds to the reserve account would be in the best interests of the development, temporarily delay the restoration until such time it reasonably determines to be necessary.
(c) shall exercise prudent fiscal management in maintaining the integrity of the reserve account, and shall, if necessary, levy a special assessment to recover the full amount of the expended funds within the time limits specified in (b) above. Any such special assessments

Any extension shall not prevent the Board from pursuing any legal remedy to enforce the collection of an unpaid special assessment.
When the decision is made to use reserve funds or to temporarily transfer money from the reserve account to pay for litigation, the Board shall notify the Members of that decision in the next available mailing to all Members pursuant to Section 5016 of the Corporations Code, and of the availability of an accounting of the expenses related to litigation on at least a quarterly basis. The accounting shall be made available for inspection by Members at the Master Association's office.

With respect to any application made by an Owner whose Residential Area Lot or Condominium is within a Sub-Association, it shall be a prerequisite to review of such application by the Architectural Control Committee that any required approval first be granted by the architectural committee, if any, of the applicable Sub-Association. The architectural committee may designate an agent (i.e. an architect) for the purpose of assisting in the review of such location, plans and specifications or other requests and may charge the Owner making a submission its reasonable costs of such agent's review. Approval shall be by majority vote of the Board or its designated committee, or the applicable subcommittee. In the event the Board or its designated committee fails to approve or disapprove such location, plans and specifications or other requests within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the submission thereof to it of a complete application with all required documents in acceptable form, then such approval will not be required; provided that any structure or Improvement so erected or altered, conforms to all of the conditions and restrictions herein contained, and is in harmony with

Section 7.4 Fences and Walls. If any fences or walls are intended by the developer thereof to be constructed by individual Owners of Residential Area Lots or detached Condominiums in any Phase of the Community, rather than by Declarant or a Merchant Builder, then each Owner of such Lots or Condominium shall construct and maintain such fences or walls along the side and rear perimeters of his Lot or Condominium in conformance with the requirements of the approved architectural guidelines applicable such Owner's Phase of the Community. Such fences and walls shall be built so as to straddle the boundary lines of a Lot or Condominium, and only one fence or wall shall be constructed on the boundary lines of adjoining Lots or Condominiums. Each Owner shall obtain all necessary permits for such construction and shall comply with all local laws and ordinances in connection with such construction. Each Owner whose Residential Area Lot or Condominium is separated from adjacent Master Common Area by a fence or wall along such boundary shall be responsible for all painting, maintenance, repair and replacement of the inside surface of such wall or fence, and shall have an easement of reasonable access over the Master Common Area for such purposes. The cost of construction and maintenance of the fences and walls shall be borne by the Owner thereof, except that, subject to Article 16 hereof, the cost of construction and maintenance for fences and walls which straddle boundary lines of adjoining Lots or Condominiums shall be borne equally by such adjoining Lots or Condominiums as required by California Civil Code Section 841. In the event any Owner fails to maintain the fences and walls as required hereunder, then the Master Association or the Architectural Control Committee may, after due notice to the Owner involved and opportunity to be heard, shall have the right of access to such Owner's Lot or Condominium to conduct such maintenance as may be necessary and said Owner shall be liable for all costs incurred by the party conducting such activities.
Section 7.5 Landscaping by Owner. Except to the extent that Declarant or a Merchant Builder may have installed front yard and side yard landscaping thereon, each Owner of a Residential Area Lot or detached Condominium, other than Declarant or a Merchant Builder, shall, within one hundred twenty (120) days after acquiring title thereto, cause the front, side and rear yards of said Lot or detached Condominium to be fully landscaped, subject to reasonable growing times, and shall thereafter cause said landscaping to be maintained in a neat and orderly manner, replacing any plant material which die or are otherwise destroyed. Such landscaping shall include street trees to be located four feet (4') from the back of the sidewalk, and planted an average of one fifteen (15) gallon tree per thirty (30) linear feet of street. Each Owner shall promptly replace any such street trees that die or are destroyed with the same species/type tree as originally planted. All planting of trees, shrubs, and landscaping, and the replacement thereof, shall be done only after approval thereof by the Architectural Control Committee and using only approved trees, shrubs and landscaping. No weeds, rubbish, debris, objects or materials of any kind, plants or seed infected with noxious insects or plant diseases shall be placed, grown or permitted to accumulate on any portion of a Lot or Condominium which renders such portion of the Lot or Condominium unsanitary, unsightly, offensive or detrimental to any Lot or Condominium in the vicinity thereof, or to the occupants of any such Lot or Condominium, or to the Master Common Area. In the event of the default in performance of this provision, Dedarant, the Architectural Control Committee, the Board or any agents thereof shall have the right to enter upon such Lot or Condominium, as provided in Section 10.4

Such work may be disapproved or conditionally approved if it will impair the stability of any Bank Area or erosion control barrier of the Lake in the absence of adequate corrective measures.
7.6.6 Special Permission. Declarant may grant the right to build structures and dwellings in the Bank Area to purchasers from Declarant, provided the Deed or another recorded document referencing such Lake Lot executed by Declarant expressly sets forth the setback limitations for the Lake Lot, and the improvements are otherwise consistent with this Master Declaration.

Neither Declarant, the Merchant Builders, the Master Association, the Board or the architectural committee, or any subcommittees thereof, or the members or designated representatives thereof, shall be liable for damages to any Owner submitting plans or specifications to them for approval, or to any Owner in the Community affected by this Master Declaration by reason of mistake in judgment, negligence or nonfeasance, unless due to willful misconduct or bad faith of the architectural committee. The architectural committee's (or subcommittee's) approval or disapproval of a submission shall be based solely on the consideration set forth in this Article, and in such rules and regulations as may be promulgated by the architectural committee, and the architectural committee shall not be responsible for reviewing, nor shall its approval of any plan or design

8.2.1 No Lot or Condominium shall be occupied and used except for residential purposes by the Owners, their tenants, and social guests, and no trade or business shall be conducted therein, except that Declarant, its successors or assigns, may use any Lot(s) or Condominium(s) in the Community owned by Declarant or Merchant Builders for a model home site or sites and display and sales office, construction yard trailers, construction office, or placement of signs, until the last Lot or Condominium is sold by Declarant or a Merchant Builder.

8.2.2 No part of the Residential Area of the Community shall ever be used or caused to be used directly, or indirectly, for any business, commercial, manufacturing, mercantile, storing, vending or other such non-residential purposes. However, the provisions of this Section shall not preclude professional and administrative occupations within the Community, or other reasonable business activity, which have no signs or other external evidence thereof, for so long as such occupations are in conformance with all applicable governmental ordinances, are merely incidental to the use of the Lot or Condominium as a residential home, do not cause any increase in the potential liability or casualty insurance premiums of the Master Association, and do not in any manner disturb other occupants or generate any pedestrian or vehicular traffic from clients, customers, employees, independent contractors, or deliveries or other form of nuisance.

from the view of the adjoining Lots, Condominiums and streets, such as within a garage. No garage shall be used at any time for residential purposes or any purpose which would interfere in any manner with the availability and use of such garage for the purpose of automobile parking for the number of vehicles for which it was intended. The foregoing restriction shall not be deemed to prevent washing and polishing of such motor vehicle, boat, trailer, camper or motor-driven cycle, together with those activities normally incident and necessary to such washing and polishing.
8.2.6 No parking of vehicles, as defined by the California Vehicle Code, shall be permitted on any private streets within the Community except within areas designated for public parking by the Board, or, except within areas subject to a Sub-Association designated by the board of directors of such Sub-Association for public parking. Except as otherwise permitted by the Board or the board of a Sub-Association, residents of the Community shall park their motor vehicles only within their respective garages or carports. Temporary loading and unloading and guest parking within private driveways which are adequate for such purpose is permitted, except in common driveways where such use might obstruct access by others. Indefinite parking of any vehicle in any street or parking area, or on any driveway, shall be prohibited. "Indefinite parking" means the parking of a vehicle for a period in excess of seventy-two (72) hours. Parking of any vehicle in a driveway in such a manner as to encroach into or obstruct traffic along the sidewalk shall be prohibited.
8.2.7 An Owner may keep and maintain in his Residential Area Lot or Condominium domesticated pets such as dogs, cats or other usual and ordinary household pets, not to exceed two (2) in number and provided that such pets shall not be allowed in the Master Common Area or recreational areas except as may be permitted by the Rules and Regulations which may be promulgated from time to time by the Board. Except as hereinabove provided, no animals, livestock, birds or poultry shall be brought within the Community or kept in any Lot or Condominium thereof. Owners keeping pets shall be accountable to the other Owners for the acts of such pets, and should any Owner be unable to control barking or other noise or acts of his pets which disturb his neighbors, he shall be required to remove such pet from the Community. Each owner of a pet shall forthwith clean up and remove any animal waste such pet may deposit on the Master Common Area or the property of another Owner. No dog will be allowed on the Master Common Area or recreational areas without being restrained on a leash and being supervised. Any Owner (including such Owner's family, guests and invitees) who maintains any pet, animal, reptile, livestock or other living creature of any kind, within the Community, whether in compliance with this Master Declaration and the Rules and Regulations or otherwise, shall indemnify, defend and hold the Master Association harmless from and against any damages, claims, causes of action or losses of any kind or nature, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs, incurred by the Master Association as a result of any alleged damage or injury caused by such living creature to the Master Association, to its property, to the Master Common Area, or to the Members, their family, guests or invitees, or their property.

8.2.8.1 The term "pit bull" dog refers to any dog which exhibits those distinguishing characteristics which substantially conform to the standards established by the American Kennel Club for American Staffordshire Terriers or Staffordshire Bull Terriers, or which substantially conform to the standards established by the United Kennel Club for the American Pit Bull Terriers.
8.2.8.2 Pit bulls must at all times be securely confined indoors or confined in a securely and completely enclosed and locked pen in a backyard area. Any such pen shall not exceed eight feet (8') in height if it is to be located within fifteen feet (15') of a Lot or Condominium boundary line, and shall be posted with a conspicuous sign displaying the words "Dangerous Dog" that complies with the Architectural Guidelines of the Master Association.
8.2.8.3 At any time that a pit bull is not confined, the dog shall be muzzled in such a manner as to prevent it from biting or injuring any person or animal, and kept on a leash.
8.2.8.4 Each Owner of a pit bull shall maintain and provide to the Master Association evidence of a liability insurance policy of not less than $300,000.00 for bodily injury or death of any person, or damage to property, which may result from the ownership, keeping or maintenance of such pit bull. Proof of insurance shall be evidenced by the filing with the Master Association of a certificate of insurance from an insurance company authorized to do business in the State of California stating that the Owner is and will be insured against liability for such damages. The Master Association may require, in place of such evidence of insurance, a surety bond or a personal bond secured by sufficient assets to be posted.
8.2.9 The erection of basketball standards or fixed sports apparatus is prohibited, except as provided in this subsection. A single basketball standard affixed to the structure of a dwelling and located over or adjacent to the garage door(s) is permitted, as is a free standing standard located immediately adjacent to a house and located so a ball in normal play cannot strike a neighboring house or go into the street. Except as provided in the next sentence, a basketball standard may not be located more than three feet (3') from the wall of a residence including an attached garage. In addition, with the written approval of the Architectural Control Committee, a basketball standard may be allowed along the outside or inside curve of a curved driveway, provided it is set back from the street as far as the wall of the residence including attached garage which is closest to the street. No basketball standard is permitted to be located on or near a sidewalk or the street. A basketball standard must be maintained in good condition and repair. Any portable basketball standard must be stored out of sight of the street or neighboring residences except when it is being used for play.
8.2.10 No oil drilling, oil development operations, oil refining, quarrying or mining operations of any kind, shall be permitted within the Community, nor shall oil wells, tanks, tunnels or mineral excavations or shafts be permitted upon the surface of or within five hundred (500) feet below the surface of the Community.

No alteration to or modification of such fiber optics cable system as developed by Declarant and the Merchant Builders, shall be permitted without prior consent of the Board and the cable television operator. Owners are prohibited from installing any antenna on the exterior of a residence for any purpose, except for an "Authorized Antenna" which may be installed so long as the proposed location for such installation is reviewed and approved by the Architectural Control Committee prior to its installation in order to ensure that the visibility of the Authorized Antenna is minimized with respect to other Owners. The Architectural Control Committee may require that the location of the Authorized Antenna be moved, and the Board may impose additional restrictions on installation or use of an Authorized Antenna, so long as such review by the Architectural Control Committee, or such additional restrictions, do not (a) unreasonably delay or prevent installation, maintenance or use of an Authorized Antenna, (b) unreasonably increase the cost of installation, maintenance or use of an Authorized Antenna, or (c) preclude reception of an acceptable quality signal. The Board may prohibit the installation of an Authorized Antenna if the installation, location or maintenance of such Authorized Antenna unreasonably affects the safety of managers, agents or employees of the Master Association and other Owners, or for any other safety related reason established by the Board.

INSURANCE
Section 11.1 Liability/Property Insurance. A master or blanket public liability and property damage insurance policy covering the Master Common Area shall be purchased by the Board of Directors as promptly as possible following its election and shall be maintained in force at all times, the premium thereon to be paid out of the monies collected from the assessments. The minimum amount of coverage shall be Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) combined single limit liability for bodily injury to any one person, or property damage for any one occurrence; if written on the new occurrence form, coverage shall be Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) in the aggregate and Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) per occurrence. The policy shall name the Master Association and all Owners as insureds, including Declarant and the Merchant Builders, during such time as Declarant or a Merchant Builder shall remain the Owner of one or more Lots or Condominiums. The Community Manager shall also be a named insured on such policy, during such time as his agency shall continue. The insurance shall also contain a cross-liability endorsement to cover negligent injury by one Owner to another, if reasonably available. The Master Association shall prepare and distribute to all Members a summary of the Master Association's property, general liability, and hazard insurance policies, which shall be distributed within sixty (60) days preceding the beginning of the Master Association's fiscal year, that includes all of the following information about each policy: (a) the name of the insurer, (b) the type of insurance, (c) the policy limits of the insurance, and (d) the amount of deductibles, if any.

be in effect by the date the existing coverage will lapse. To the extent that any of the information required to be disclosed pursuant to this paragraph is specified in the insurance policy declaration page, the Master Association may meet its obligation to disclose that information by making copies of that page and distributing it to all Members. The summary distributed pursuant to this paragraph shall contain in at least 10-point boldface type, the statement required by Civil Code Section 1365(0(4).
Section 11.2 Hazard Insurance. The Board of Directors shall purchase a master or blanket policy of all-risk or named peril (fire, extended coverage, vandalism and malicious mischief) insurance issued by a Qualified Insurer, as defined herein, providing coverage equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the current replacement cost of all Master Common Area improvements to the Community then subject to assessments under Article 5 of the Master Declaration (including all service and mechanical equipment in the Master Common Area). "Qualified Insurer" means any insurance company having a Best's Insurance Reports rating of (a) a B general policyholder's rating and a III financial size category, or (b) an A general policyholder's rating and a II financial size category, and licensed in the State of California. Said insurance policy shall contain an earthquake damage endorsement if the Board determines that coverage is reasonably necessary and reasonably available at a cost deemed to be in the best interests of the Members. Replacement cost may exclude land, foundations, excavation, and other items normally excluded from coverage. All hazard insurance required to be maintained by the Board hereunder shall be maintained to meet or exceed the requirements of the provisions contained in the FHLMC Seller/Servicer Guide, as recommended by the insurance agent for the Master Association. The premiums for said insurance policy shall be paid by the Board out of the monies collected from the assessments. The policy may also contain an agreed amount endorsement, a special form endorsement, and a clause to permit cash settlement covering the full value of the improvements in the event of partial destruction and a decision not to rebuild. The policy shall name as insureds all Owners and Declarant and the Merchant Builders, so long as Declarant or a Merchant Builder is the Owner of any Lot or Condominium within the Community, and all Mortgagees of record, as their respective interests may appear. The proportionate interest of each Owner in any insurance proceeds in relation to the other Owners, shall be based upon a ratio of each Lot's or Condominium's "fair market value" to the "fair market value" of the entire Community. The "fair market value" in both instances, shall be determined by an independent appraiser. In the event that the insurer under said hazard insurance policy shall cease to be licensed in the State of California, or shall cease to be approved by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (so long as insurers continue to be so approved), the Master Association shall exercise its best efforts to obtain from another Qualified Insurer, a replacement hazard policy comparable to the prior hazard policy, including all required endorsements.
11.2.1 Personal property of a Lot or Condominium Owner and additional fixtures added by a Lot or Condominium Owner should be insured separately by the Lot or Condominium Owner.

If reconstruction is to take place, the Board of Directors shall be required to execute, acknowledge, file and record, not later than one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of said destruction, a certificate declaring the intention of the Master Association to rebuild.
Section 12.2 Proceeds Less Than Eighty-Five Percent (85%) of Cost to Repair.

In the event of failure or refusal by any Owner to pay his proportionate share, after notice to him, should such failure or refusal continue for a period of sixty (60) days, the Board of Directors may levy a special assessment against such Owner, which may be enforced under the lien provisions, hereinbefore contained.

12.5.1 Any insurance proceeds available for such rebuilding shall be distributed among the Owners and their individual lenders by the Board, as their respective interests may appear. The proportionate interests of each Owner in said proceeds in relation to other Owners shall be based upon a ratio of each Lot's and Condominium's "fair market value," just prior to destruction. "Fairmarket value" shall be determined by an independent appraiser.
12.5.2 The Board shall have the duty, within one hundred twenty (120) days of the date of such loss, to execute, acknowledge and record a certificate setting forth the determination of the Master Association not to rebuild, and shall promptly cause to be prepared and filed, such

13.1.1 No breach of any of the covenants, conditions and restrictions herein contained, nor the enforcement of any lien provisions herein, shall defeat or render invalid the lien of any first Mortgage (meaning a Mortgage with first priority over any other Mortgage) on any Lot or Condominium made in good faith and for value, but all of said covenants, conditions and restrictions shall be binding upon and effective against any Owner whose title is derived through foreclosure or trustee's sale, or otherwise.

The lien assessments provided for herein shall be subordinate to the lien of any first Mortgage now or hereafter placed upon a Lot or Condominium subject to assessment; provided, however, that such subordination shall apply only to assessments which have become due and payable prior to a sale or transfer of such Lot or Condominium pursuant to a decree of foreclosure or trustee sale. Such sale or transfer shall not release such Lot or Condominium from liability for any assessments thereafter becoming due, nor from the lien of any such subsequent assessment.

13.1.9 In the event of substantial damage to or destruction of any Lot or Condominium or any element of the Master Common Area or possible condemnation or eminent domain procedure, the Institutional Lender under any first Mortgage on a Lot or Condominium is entitled to timely written notice of any such damage, destruction or proposed acquisition and no provision in the Bylaws, nor in this Master Declaration shall be interpreted to entitle any Owner or any other party to priority over any first Mortgagee with respect to the distribution to such Owner of any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards for losses to, or a taking of, Lots, Condominiums and/or Master Common Areas.
13.1.10 Any agreement for professional management of the Community, or any other contract providing for services by the Declarant or a Merchant Builder shall provide for termination by either party without cause or payment of a termination fee upon thirty (30) days'

13.1.12 No breach of any of the foregoing covenants shall cause any forfeiture of title or reversion or bestow any right of re-entry whatsoever, but in the event that any one or more of these covenants shall be violated, the Declarant, its successors and assigns, the Merchant Builders, or the Master Association, or any Owner may commence a legal action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin or abate said violation, and/or to recover damages; provided, that any such violation shall not defeat or render invalid the lien of any Mortgage made in good faith and for value as to said Lot or Condominium or any part thereof. Said covenants shall be binding upon and effective against any Owner whose title is acquired by foreclosure, trustee's sale or otherwise.
13.1.13 First Mortgagees of Lots or Condominiums may, jointly or singly, pay taxes or other charges which are in default and which may or have become a charge against any Master Common Area and may pay overdue premiums on hazard insurance policies, or secure new hazard insurance coverage on the lapse of a policy, for such Master Common Area and first Mortgagees making such payments shall be owed immediate reimbursement therefor from the Master Association.

	19.10.1	The Board of Directors shall consider and vote on the question of action
by the Master Association to enforce the obligations under the Bond with respect to any improvements for which a Notice of Completion has not been filed within sixty (60) days after the completion date specified for such improvements in the Planned Construction Statement appended to the Bond.

Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the filing of any civil action by the Master Association against the Declarant, a Merchant Builder, or other developer of the Community for alleged damage to the Master Common Area, alleged damage to the Lots or Condominiums that the Master Association is obligated to maintain or repair, or alleged damage to the Lots that arises out of, or is integrally related, to damage to the Master Common Area or Lots that the Master Association is obligated to maintain or repair, the Board shall provide written notice to each Member who appears on the records of the Master Association at the time notice is given, specifying (a) that a meeting of Members will be held to discuss problems that may lead to the filing of a civil action, (b) the options, including civil actions, that are available to address the problems, and (c) the time and place of the

meeting. All references to "Declarant" in this Article shall be deemed to refer equally to any Merchant Builder who is alleged to be responsible for any such alleged damage. If the Master Association has reason to believe that the applicable statute of limitations will expire before the Master Association files the civil action, the Master Association may give the foregoing notice not later than thirty (30) days after the filing of the action.
Section 20.2 Disputes Resolution. Any disputes between all or any of the Master Association, a Sub-Association, Owner(s), the Declarant, Merchant Builder(s), or any director, officer, partner, employer, contractor, design professional, consultant, subcontractor or agent of the Declarant or Merchant Builder(s) (collectively "Declarant Parties"), arising under this Master Declaration or relating to the Properties (but excluding disputes between Declarant and Merchant Builder(s), shall be subject to the following provisions of this Section 20.2 and the following Section 20.3.
20.2.1 Construction Defect Disputes. Prior to the commencement of any legal action by the Master Association, any Sub-Association or any Owner against the Master Association, Declarant or any Declarant Party based upon a claim for defects in the design or construction of any Lot or Condominium, Master Common Area, or any Improvements thereon, the Master Association, Sub-Association or such Owner must first comply with all of the applicable requirements of Civil Code Section 1375, as the same may be amended from time to time, or any successor statute thereto (notwithstanding the fact that said Section 1375 does not by its terms apply to Owners). If the parties to such dispute are unable to resolve their dispute in accordance with the procedures established under Civil Code Section 1375, as the same may be amended from time to time, or any successor statute, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the judicial reference provisions of Section 20.3 below and the parties to the dispute shall each be responsible for their own attorneys' fees.
20.2.2 Other Disputes. Any other disputes arising under this Master Declaration, or otherwise, between the Master Association, any Sub-Association, or any Owner and any Declarant Party (except for any action taken by the Master Association against Declarant or a Merchant Builder for delinquent assessments, and any action involving enforcement of any completion bonds) (but excluding disputes between Merchant Builder(s) and Declarant) shall be resolved in accordance with the judicial reference provisions of Section 20.3 below. The dispute resolution procedure in Section 20.3, as it applies solely to disputes under this Section 20.2.2, shall be deemed to satisfy the alternative dispute requirements of Civil Code Section 1354, or any successor statute, as applicable.
Section 20.3 Judicial Reference. It is the intention of Declarant that, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all disputes arising under this Master Declaration, based upon which litigation is filed, shall be resolved by judicial reference under California law. Accordingly, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Master Declaration (such as with respect to collection of delinquent assessments), any dispute between the Master Association or any Owner(s) and the Declarant, or Merchant Builder(s), or other developer of the Community, or between the Master Association and any Owner, with respect to the interpretation of

any of the provisions of this Master Declaration, or with respect to any alleged breach hereof, or with respect to any other claim related to the Properties, including, without limitation, any unresolved claim arising out of any alleged latent or patent construction or design defect in the Community or any part thereof, any judicial determination to be made under California Civil Code Section 1375(h), or for alleged damage to the Master Common Area, alleged damage to the Lots or Condominiums that the Master Association is obligated to maintain or repair, or any alleged damage to the Lots or Condominiums that arises out of, or is integrally related, to damage to the Master Common Area or Lots or Condominiums that the Master Association is obligated to maintain or repair, shall be heard by a referee pursuant to the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 638.1 and 641 through 645.1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Master Declaration, this Section shall not be amended without the written consent of Declarant. In the event litigation is filed based upon any such dispute, the following shall apply:
20.3.1 The proceeding shall be brought and held in the County in which the Properties are located, unless the parties agree to an alternative venue.
20.3.2 The parties shall use the procedures adopted by JAMS/ENDISPUTE ("JAMS") for judicial reference and selection of a referee (or any other entity offering judicial reference dispute resolution procedures as may be mutually acceptable to the parties).
20.3.3 The referee must be a retired judge or a licensed attorney with substantial experience in relevant real estate matters.
20.3.4 The parties to the litigation shall agree upon a single referee who shall have the power to try any and all of the issues raised, whether of fact or of law, which may be pertinent to the matters in dispute, and to issue a statement of decision thereon. Any dispute regarding the selection of the referee shall be resolved by JAMS or the entity providing the reference services, or, if no entity is involved, by the court in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 638 and 640.
20.3.5 The referee shall be authorized to provide all remedies available in law or equity appropriate under the circumstances of the controversy, other than punitive damages.
20.3.6 The referee may require one or more pre-hearing conferences.
20.3.7 The parties shall be entitled to discovery, and the referee shall oversee discovery
and may enforce all discovery orders in the same manner as any trial court judge.
20.3.8 A stenographic record of the trial shall be made, provided that the record shall remain confidential except as may be necessary for post-hearing motions and any appeals.
20.3.9 The referee's statement of decision shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law to the extent applicable.

20.3.10 The referee shall have the authority to rule on all post-hearing motions in the same manner as a trial judge.
20.3.11 The parties shall promptly and diligently cooperate with each other and the referee and perform such acts, as may be necessary for an expeditions resolution of the dispute.
20.3.12 The costs of such proceeding, including the fees of a referee, shall be borne equally by the parties to the dispute.
20.3.13 The statement of decision of the referee upon all of the issues considered by the referee shall be binding upon the parties, and upon filing of the statement of decision with the clerk of the court, or with the judge where there is no clerk, judgment may be entered thereon. The decision of the referee shall be appealable as if rendered by the court. This provision shall in no way be construed to limit any valid cause of action which may be brought by any of the parties. The parties acknowledge and accept that they are waiving their right to a jury trial.
Section 20.4 Use of Damage Award Amounts. Any and all amounts awarded to a claimant on account of a claimed construction or design defect, or damage suffered as a result thereof, shall be expended by such claimant for the attorney fees and costs of the proceeding and the repair, rehabilitation, or remediation of the claimed defect or damage.
Section 20.5 Disputes Relating To Enforcement Of Governing Documents. In the event of a dispute between the Master Association and an Owner, or between an Owner and another Owner, relating to the enforcement of the governing documents of the Master Association, the parties shall comply with the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1354(b) through (j), prior to filing of any civil action.
